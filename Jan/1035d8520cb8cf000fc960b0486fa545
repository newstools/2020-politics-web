Head of Land Committee proves land expropriation is about power 23 January 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0']));The Solidarity Movement today strongly criticised statements by the ANC, namely that the executive must decide when expropriation without compensation (EWC) is permissible, as this confirms that this process is not about land but about power. This came after the chairperson of the Parliamentary Ad Hoc Committee tasked with amending section 25 of the Constitution, MatholeMotshekga, said in a recent interview on eNCA that the ANC disagreed with the current bill, which they themselves had tabled, and which gives the courts the authority to decide when zero compensation may be permitted. The ANC believes that the executive authority should rather have this power, as court processes take time and South Africans cannot wait another 25 years to tackle the issue of land. “It is a major cause for concern that the ANC is continuing to hijack EWC by placing this process in the hands of the president and his cabinet. These statements once again prove that the ANC’s only priority is the acquisition of absolute power. Therefore, expropriation without compensation should be opposed unconditionally, irrespective of whether this power is vested in the courts or the executive. The illusion that an ideological separation of powers exists between the three legs of government is just that – an illusion,” said Francois Redelinghuys, Communications Manager of the Solidarity Movement. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','1']));“However, Motshekga hereby creates the illusion that land ownership is a crucial issue for South Africans and that the process must be accelerated, which is contrary to the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform’s own findings that 94,7% of people in the land reform process prefer monetary compensation over land ownership.  The Institute of Race Relations also found in 2019 that only 6% of people believe land reforms should be one of the government’s top priorities. This confirms that EWC is not all that important to citizens, but rather a way for the ANC to award itself the power to legally steal from all of us,” Redelinghuys explained. Motshekga further explained how this change will be made through legitimate procedures, such as public hearings and the input of other political parties – as this is not just an ANC process. "The ANC’s assurance that procedures will be followed is not really reassuring. In 2019, in the midst of the public hearing process, President Ramaphosa actually announced that the ANC will continue with EWC – despite the fact that written public input overwhelmingly opposed EWC. This example serves as proof that the ANC will not hesitate to steamroll fair procedures and opposition in pursuit its own interests,” Redelinghuys explained. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));“Expropriation without compensation will give the government the power to deprive us of one of the pillars of freedom. This gross violation of property rights must be opposed in principle, regardless of how it is administered,” Redelinghuys argued. Redelinghuys confirmed that institutions of the Movement, including AfriForum and Solidarity, will submit written comments in opposition to the proposal.
