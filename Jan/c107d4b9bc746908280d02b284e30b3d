Comprehensive Sexuality Education: Minister Motshekga owes country a public explanation 28 January 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_3',112,'0','0']));According to media reports, the Minister of Basic Education, Ms Angie Motshekga, conceded that schools can decide whether and how they are going to present the scripted lesson plans for comprehensive sexuality education (CSE). This followed her engagement with education trade unions. The FF Plus welcomes this step because it demonstrates the party's standpoint that teachers are professionals and, therefore, they should have the final say when it comes to determining the curriculum. The FF Plus also believes that education is an expression of culture and, thus, it should be under the control of the relevant cultural groups and not the central control of the government as is currently the case. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','1']));This concession to the trade unions does not come as a surprise. Various trade unions strongly objected to the CSE and they have the power to charge the Minister with allegations of civil disobedience in an already problematic context. Minister Motshekga's most recent statement stands in stark contrast to her attitude in Parliament last year. At the time, she reacted to the criticism against the scripted lesson plans in a derogatory way. What has happened here should serve as a sign to the ANC. It may be possible to use their parliamentary majority to steamroller all opposition, but the reality outside of Parliament is more complex than that. At the same time, civil society should be encouraged by this as it shows that even an arrogant government like the ANC has to take concrete reality into account. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_4',114,'0','0']));The Minister, however, still needs to clarify the contradictions between her statements in Parliament and her statements to the trade unions with a public explanation.
