"There are rumours doing the rounds that they ate tainted chips and cheese, but the police will only be able to get an idea of the cause of their deaths once post-mortems and forensic tests have been conducted," police spokesperson Captain Andre Beetge said in a statement on Monday. A formal inquest docket has been opened, and the police are calling on anyone with information that could assist the investigation to come forward. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_7',114,'0','0']));Motherwell cluster commander Major General Dawie Rabie conveyed his condolences to all the families affected by the tragedy.
