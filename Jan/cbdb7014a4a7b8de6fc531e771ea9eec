EFF statement on Communication Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams abuse of state resources through her husband 19 January 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));The EFF condemns the alleged abuse of tax payer's money by the Communication Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams to fund private benefits for her husband and herself. Minister Ndabeni-Abrahams allegedly used tax payer's money to fund her wedding anniversary celebrations in the United States and Switzerland. Minister Ndabeni-Abrahams got her husband to participate in government activities of which he is not authorised to, including interviewing candidates for positions on the various boards for which she has political oversight. During the international trip, she took without the approval of the President and to celebrate her wedding anniversary, her husband also attended official meetings. The EFF is outraged by the continuing tendencies of Ministers who treat state resources and use tax payer's money as they wish. Ministers get their partners to participate in functions and duties which they are not elected or appointed for; these actions breed corruption and irregularities. The EFF was made aware of all these allegations even before the newspaper reports and we will write to the Public Protector to ask her to investigate if there was a breach of the code of ethics. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0']));The EFF will write to President Ramaphosa to demand that he take strong action on Minister Ndabeni-Abrahams' alleged abuse of state resources. Failure to take action immediately will be another demonstration of both indecisiveness and lack of leadership by the President. The EFF calls on the Ministers' husband to stay away from performing functions and duties he was not elected or appointed to perform.
