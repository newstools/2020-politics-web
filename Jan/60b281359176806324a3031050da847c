ANC Statement on the First Day of school in 2020 14 January 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_6',112,'0','0']));ANC in the Western Cape wishes all school learners, particularly those entering the schooling system for the first time in 2020, a wonderful first day of school tomorrow and a very successful academic year. Every year of school is important as part of the continuum that ultimately leads to a successful final year and itâ€™s important for learners to commit to their studies as early as possible. As the year starts, we therefore encourage all the learners to put an equal vigor and determination in all their learning, irrespective of the class. This is to also ensure that learners do not stay longer in the schooling system than is necessary. As the ANC we know that one of the great contributors to the success of learners is a conducive learning environment, anchored by a great relationship between all stakeholders in the educations system, teachers, learners, governing bodies, unions and the department. We call on the Western Cape Provincial Government to work with all stakeholders in the sector to ensure that all problems identified in the previous year, which have also led to less than desirable Matric results are adequately dealt with. This will ensure a much more successful academic year in 2020. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_4',113,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_5',113,'0','1']));We will continue as the ANC on our campaign to ensure that all children in the Province have equal access to services and resources and we call on the Western Cape Education Department to address the disparities between rich and working class schools in relation to infrastructure, ICT, science labs and libraries. In this regard, ANC shadow MEC of education, comrade Muhammed Khalid Sayed, and Interim Provincial Coordinator RonaldaNalumango, will be visiting Florida Secondary School in Ravensmead at 11h30, as part of ANC programme to assess state of readiness for the year. This progamme includes assessing whether schools have the necessary learning material and resources to start the school year, that all eligible learners are enrolled and in attendance; and that all teachers are ready and well equipped for the year, so as to ensure minimal disruption on teaching and learning.
