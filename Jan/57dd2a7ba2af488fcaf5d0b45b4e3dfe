NEHAWU statement on the appointment of NECSA board 22 January 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));The National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union [NEHAWU] welcomes the announcement by the Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy, Mr Gwede Mantashe, on the appointment of the new [Nuclear Energy Corporation of South] NECSA Board and the appointment of Mr David Nicholis as the Board Chairperson. As NEHAWU, we believe that this is a very important step in restoring good governance and stability in the organization. It gives all of us another chance to turn NECSA around from the destructive path under the previous Board, and place it once more in the path of growth and sustainability. Mr Nicholis has vast experience gained across the World and in South Africa in particular. He has worked as the Chief Nuclear Officer at ESKOM and worked on the Small Modular Reactor [PBMR] with NECSA. He has always been at the forefront of championing the nuclear industry in South Africa and has keen interest in seeing NECSA grow and taking its rightful place in the future of the South African economy and the health of our citizens. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','1']));We are making a clarion call to the Board to lead by example in inculcating a culture of good governance and at all times place the interests of NECSA above those of their own. None of them should individually or collectively act in a manner that dishonours the organisation. NEHAWU is more than prepared to work with the new board and CEO to turn the organisation around in order to ensure that it plays its strategic role in nuclear energy, technology research and development both nationally and internationally. We welcome the commitment that salaries will be paid on the 24th January 2020 and that more funds will be sourced to pay all benefits to all our members and workers. The new board must hit the ground running in fixing the dire financial state of NECSA and ensure that it stays financially afloat. Moving forward we will watch the work of the new board with hawk eyes and guard against any wrongdoings. As the majority union, we will work with the Board to make NECSA a prosperous organisation and wish them all the best.
