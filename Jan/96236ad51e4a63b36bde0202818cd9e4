DA Gauteng wishes all learners well for the 2020 academic year 14 January 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng wishes all learners well as the schools reopen tomorrow. The Gauteng Department of Education has assured parents and learners that they are ready for the 2020 academic year. However, past experience has shown that this is not the case with all schools in this province. Some parents are in limbo as they are waiting for their children to be allocated to a school. Furthermore, we would like to encourage those matric learners who did not pass to register for the supplementary examinations and those who don’t qualify should consider repeating matric. We urge parents to get involved in their children’s education as well as in instilling discipline amongst learners. Parents should take ownership of our schools to prevent criminals from destroying school infrastructure. The DA believes that quality education at all levels is the most powerful tool for unlocking opportunities and reducing poverty. We will be monitoring the state of readiness of all our schools across the province to ensure that all learners receive a quality education.
