This was revealed by the Gauteng MEC for Education, Panyaza Lesufi in a written reply to the DA questions tabled in the Gauteng Provincial Legislature (GPL). According to the MEC, there are 10 schools that are within 500 metres of liquor outlets in Ward 73 Benoni. He states that his department and the Liquor Board frequently interact regarding the approval of liquor licenses for outlets situated near schools. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_3',113,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_4',113,'0','1']));This clearly indicates that the Gauteng Liquor Board is contravening Section 30 (3) of the Gauteng Liquor Act 2 of 2003 which states that the Gauteng Liquor Board shall grant an application in the case of premises not situated within a radius of 500 metres in the vicinity of a place of worship and educational institution. These liquor outlets have a negative impact on learning and teaching at these 10 schools. The DA calls on the Gauteng MEC for Economic Development, MorakaneMosupyoe to ensure that the Gauteng Liquor Board enforces the law and complies in terms of issuing licenses to liquor outlets that are within 500 metres of these educational institutions. We demand that action be taken against those liquor outlets that are contravening Section 30 (3) of the Gauteng Liquor Act 2 of 2003. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_1',114,'0','0']));We will also be tabling questions to MEC Mosupyoe to ascertain what action will be taken against these liquor outlets and whether they intend to shut them down.
