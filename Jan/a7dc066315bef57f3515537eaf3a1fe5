Mamusa by-election: DA is disappointed with results 16 January 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_7',112,'0','0']));As results are coming in following the by-election in Mamusa yesterday, it is evident that the ANC will be elected back into government and that the DA has lost Ward 9 to the Freedom Front Plus. The by-election followed the dissolution of the municipality in October after service delivery completely collapsed. We have learnt serious lessons over the past year and acknowledge that the mistakes we made in 2019 contributed to the defeat. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','1']));The DA will be finalising its investigation into the mishandling of the Schweizer-Reneke matter and will communicate the outcome soon. We believe that the people of Mamusa deserve better, but we respect the voters’ choice. We would like to thank every voter for their support and regardless of the outcome, we remain resolute to fight for the people of Mamusa to receive the services they are entitled to.
