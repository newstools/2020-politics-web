NSFAS on applications outcome for the 2020 Academic Year 6 January 2020 Following the extensive outreach campaign, which saw NSFAS officials reaching out to small towns and rural areas, we are happy to report that by November 30, 2019 the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) had received a record number of 543 268 first-time ever applications (prior year 428 929) by the closing date. NSFAS has prioritised the poor and vulnerable students and to this end just under 50% of applications have been received from social grant beneficiaries. The personal details and social welfare status of all applications have been validated with the Department of Home Affairs and the Department of Social Development. This is a major improvement in NSFAS administration, as communication of funding decision prior to the commencement of the academic year will allow students to enrol at tertiary institution without having to pay upfront registration fees. As in prior years it is expected that a significant number of students will apply after they have registered at TVET colleges in January 2020, in the previous year this category of students amounted to 160 000. NSFAS, in conjunction with the TVET sector, instituted additional administrative support to ensure rapid processing and turnaround. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));Students previously funded by NSFAS and will be continuing their studies in 2020 will be funded based on progression results to be received from the institutions. We are encouraged that most of applications were submitted through the electronic portal with only 15 000 applications submitted manually. The highest number of applications received were from KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo and Gauteng Province. About 80% of applicants have indicated that universities are their first choice of study. Funding decisions for the 2020 applications have been updated on the myNSFAS portal profiles. Applicants are advised to check and track their application status updates online. Applicants who do not have the myNSFAS portal profiles are encouraged to register on the website in order to ensure they have sight of their funding status. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_1',114,'0','0']));Applications with outstanding supporting documents: From the total number of applications received, 69 357 applications were incomplete or may have outstanding or incorrect supporting documents.
