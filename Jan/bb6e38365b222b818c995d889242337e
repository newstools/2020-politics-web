Constitutional delinquent Maile beats a hasty retreat 27 January 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) notes the press statement issued by MEC Maile wherein he announced that he has abandoned his unlawful attempt to suspend Councillors Katlego Mathebe and Vasco da Gama without pay. No doubt, his lawyers advised him that he would lose the legal case initiated by the DA. He would be exposed as having abused his powers and as being a constitutional delinquent. But it is not enough that the DA and its CouncillorsMathebe and da Gama have been vindicated. Maile must face consequences. In this regard, Councillors Mathebe and da Gama are seeking legal advice to pursue Maile for impugning their integrity. Moreover, the DA will be tabling a Motion in the Gauteng Provincial Legislature calling upon Premier David Makhura to remove Maile as MEC. Maile is a serial abuser of power who lacks even a basic understanding of his role in overseeing local government. Issued by Mike Moriarty,Gauteng Provincial Chairperson, 27 January 2020
