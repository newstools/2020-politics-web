Universities should be utilised to empower youth and not become places of conflict 29 January 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_3',112,'0','0']));The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the North West Province is concerned about the reported violence at the North West University, Mafikeng Campus and calls for calm during the current protest action. The protest action follows after the South African Union of Students listed 15 unresolved grievances dating back to the 2016 “fees must fall” campaign. It is crucial that this is resolved urgently so that learning at this institution can continue without further delay. We are particularly saddened by the fact that the registration of new students has been brought to a standstill, having a devastating impact on these new students and the academic year. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','1']));It is incumbent on the University and, where necessary, the Minister of Higher Education, Blade Nzimande, to engage in constructive discussions with the students. Shutting down the NWU Mafikeng campus due to violence and intimidation goes against the very idea of quality higher education. We are firm in our belief that illegal acts should be a matter for the police to deal with and urge students to refrain from damaging property or harassing other students. No grievance can justify the prevention of learning and therefore the DA will continue to monitor the situation closely to ensure that daily operations resume as soon as possible.
