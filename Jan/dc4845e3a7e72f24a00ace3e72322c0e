"Following this incident, the community marched to the Alexandra police station on Thursday demanding answers and the arrest of the officer they alleged to have killed Mathane-Radebe. "An inquest is being conducted by the Independent Police Investigative Directorate [IPID] to establish the facts around this incident. The police have confirmed that firearms used by the officers during the shootout have been taken away and booked in for ballistic testing. "I wish to send my condolences to Mathane-Radebe's family. My heart is with her family, her husband and young children she left behind. I would also like to wish the man who is in hospital a speedy recovery," said Mazibuko. She asked residents to allow IPID to complete its investigation. "I would like to plead with the community of Alexandra to remain calm while IPID is investigating the circumstances pertaining to the shooting. Until it has been established whose firearm shot and killed Mathane-Radebe, I would like to request that the community exercise restraint. "I can assure them that if it is found that the bullet that killed Radebe was fired by the officer, the law will take its course without fear or favour, and appropriate action will be taken," Mazibuko said.
