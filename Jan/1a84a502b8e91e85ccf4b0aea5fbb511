Sports Arts and Culture on proposed amendments to sport bills 9 January 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0']));The Department of Sport and Recreation South Africa has commenced with the process of amending both National Sport and Recreation Act No. 110 of 1998 and South African Institute For Drug - Free Sport Act 25 of 2006. Both documents referred to as the draft Amendment Bills are currently on various public platforms for all interested parties and the public at large who have keen interest in them to submit their written representations to the Department. Unfortunately, two dates were therefore listed on both adverts with this somehow sparking confusion on the final date for written submissions by interested parties. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));The Department of Sport and Recreation South Africa takes this opportunity to apologise for the confusion the mentioning of both dates for submission of written presentation this might have sparked as initially appeared on SRSA website. Kindly note that the confirmed and final date for written representations is the 28 February 2020. Those who still have to submit, kindly forward your written inputs on or before 28 February 2020 to Adv.
