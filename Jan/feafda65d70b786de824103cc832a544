This attack has proved yet again, that no one in South Africa is safe, and that crime affects us all. We can report that senior MP Mr Mackenzie, was shot in the shoulder, and we are pleased to be able to let the public know that he is recovering well from surgery. We are offering him and his family support and love during this horrendous ordeal. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));South Africans live in perpetual fear. No place and no person is safe. Our economy and our people suffer daily because of the scourge of crime, and we call on the South African Police Service to act swiftly to bring the perpetrators to justice. This act of senseless violence reminds us all that the fight against crime remains one of our top priorities. We must continue this fight on behalf of al South Africans to ensure that our country is made safe, our people no longer live in fear and that criminals are prosecuted and bought to book. Our thoughts are with Mr Mackenzie and his family, and indeed with all South Africans, who have suffered at the hands of criminals for far too long.
