Minister Aaron Motsoaledi on arrest of immigration official Sam Langa 17 January 2020 The Minister of Home Affairs Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi welcomes the arrest of immigration official Sam Langa who was arrested during a sting operation by the police on 09 January 2020 and appeared in court on 13 January 2020. Langa is alleged to have demanded over R100 000 from a foreign businessman who was in the country illegally to allegedly ensure that the businesman and other foreigners were not deported back to their country of origin. Langa faces charges of corruption, extortion and defeating the ends of justice. He is in custody and is expected to reappear in court tomorrow, 15 January 2020. "We shall spare no effort in rooting out corruption and malfeasance in all its forms in the Department. The Department will work with the police and all law enforcement agencies to ensure that transgressors face the full might of the law," said Minister Motsoaledi. Minister Motsoaledi bemoaned the fact that Langa is actually a law enforcement officer whose job is to make sure that the law is upheld, adhered to and respected. This fact alone aggravates the alleged transgressions of Langa. Minister Motsoaledi echoed the call from the police that anyone who may have any information on such corrupt activities or any other criminal activities to contact the SA Police Service. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));
