Mkhize must explain process followed with appointment 28 January 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));The FF Plus will request the Minister of Health, Zweli Mkhize, to provide more clarity about the appointment of his niece, Sibusisiwe Ngubane Zulu, as his new chief of staff. Among other things, the FF Plus wants to know where the relevant position was advertised, how many candidates applied for the position, how many interviews were conducted with candidates and how the decision was made to appoint his niece in the position. The FF Plus views Zulu's appointment as a cause for concern seeing as she was implicated in corruption during her term of office at the Public Investment Corporation (PIC). eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));To the FF Plus it seems that this is just one of many cases where people, who were implicated in irregularities, simply resign from one position in order to avoid being prosecuted just to be appointed in yet another high-ranking position. What exactly transpired between Zulu and the PIC is not known and clarity must be provided regarding why she left her position in a cloud of controversy, as described by the media. Even though Zulu is apparently not facing any criminal charges, the FF Plus wants to know why there are rumours that she might be able to have some influence on the implementation of the National Health Insurance (NHI). Mkhize must be open and honest about why he appointed Zulu and the FF Plus will not hesitate to take the necessary steps if it comes to light that the correct appointment procedures were not followed.
