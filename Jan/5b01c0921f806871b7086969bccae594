AfriForum Youth demands action from UFS management after disruptions during student registrations 27 January 2020 AfriForum Youth wrote a letter to the management of the University of the Free State (UFS) today demanding action against Student Representative Council (SRC) members and other protesters, after continuous disruption of the 2020 registration process. This follows after the SRC, members of the South African Students’ Congress (Sasco) and EFF student leaders started protesting last week while the university failed to take precautionary measures to end the protests. Personnel who are assisting students with the registration process are being intimidated and verbally abused by protesters. Some personnel had to be accompanied to their vehicles by security personnel. “AfriForum Youth has directed an urgent letter to Pura Mgolombane, Dean of Student Affairs, in which we request management to act against the protesters who are being led by the SRC, and that the necessary precautions be taken to ensure the safety of students and personnel,” says Chantelle du Preez, National Coordinator for AfriForum Youth. AfriForum Youth has had numerous meetings with the UFS management to ensure that the necessary safety measures are implemented to prevent these type of incidents and also to offer their help in this regard. However, the management of UFS has continually assured AfriForum of their ability to handle it. “AfriForum’s safety team is on standby to assist members and non-protesting students, should the university be unable to guarantee their students’ safety,” says Joseph Renaud, AfriForum’s Head of Community Safety for the Central Region. AfriForum Youth will continue putting pressure on the management of universities to ensure the safety of students and personnel on their campuses. The UFS management has until 29 January at 12:00 to respond to AfriForum Youth’s correspondence. Issued by Carina Bester, Media Relations Officer, AfriForum, 27 January 2020
