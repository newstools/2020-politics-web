Lesufi’s on-line registration system for schools is causing chaos and must be abolished 13 January 2020 The FF Plus demands that the on-line registration system for schools in Gauteng must be abolished at once. At present, there are thousands of Gauteng learners who have not yet been placed at schools due to the extensive administrative red tape created by the on-line registration system that was implemented by the Gauteng MEC for Education, Panyaza Lesufi. These learners and their parents are extremely worried and feel uncertain about whether they will be placed at the right schools seeing as placements will only be finalised by Wednesday according to the Gauteng Department of Education. It is clear that the system is just creating chaos and, thus, the province should revert back to using the previous system where parents themselves had to apply for their children to be placed at the school of their choice. The FF Plus is convinced that the system is not functioning properly and that it was created with the aim of changing Afrikaans schools' demography by means of artificial manipulation and so destroy these schools' Afrikaans character. Thus, the FF Plus decided that the system must be investigated by the Public Protector (PP) and consequently lodged a complaint about it with the PP. Last year in the Gauteng Legislature, the FF Plus addressed probing questions about the system in writing to Lesufi and his Department. Interestingly enough, it seems that these questions were not replied to last year and so the party will submit them again this year. The FF Plus plans to launch various actions this year to improve the Gauteng school system and to neutralise Lesufi's political influence.
