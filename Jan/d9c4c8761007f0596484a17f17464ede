FAWU statement on the start of inquest trial into Neil Aggett death 20 January 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));The Food and Allied Workers’ Union welcomes the long-awaited inquest trial review that started today in the South Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg on Dr. Neil Aggett’s untimely death on 5 February 1982 in his cell during detention in the John Voster Square.    Dr. Aggett was a passionate trade unionist and anti-apartheid activist who played an important role in organising workers into the Food and Canning Workers’ Union (now FAWU). Along with his family, friends and fellow activists we remain hopeful that we will get answers to some of the burning questions as to what exactly transpired on that fateful day. Reviewing the initial outcomes of similar investigations referred by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission many years ago, is crucial for affected families to find closure, especially in cases where the initial findings were inconclusive or simply unconvincing. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));Many of those who knew Dr. Aggett outright defied the outcome of his initial inquest that he had committed suicide, and suspected foul play by the then security forces. Many anti-apartheid activists in detention at the same time, reported that detainees were routinely and relentlessly tortured at the John Voster Square facility. Like many others, FAWU (Food and Canning Workers’ Union) also held on to the belief that apartheid security police was responsible for his untimely passing. We will watch the trial, precided over by Judge Motsamai Makume, closely over the next few weeks in the hope to get some answers to questions that have been haunting us for decades. Family, friends and activists of victims gained renewed fervour that similar cases would be reviewed in light of the outcome of the Ahmed Timol investigation, in which the initial ruling was overturned. It is just sad that so many years have been wasted during which key witnesses has since passed on before these actions were finally announced.
