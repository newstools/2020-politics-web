We will not allow any public representative to jeopardise our reputation as the party of good governance. Therefore we have decided to take decisive action to restore the integrity of the DA administration in George. In addition, the party has pursued our own internal action steps and has written to Mayor Naik to give him notice of our intention to place him on suspension. He has opportunity to provide reasons why this should not happen.
