Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA) looting SA tax money 30 January 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));The Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA) is misleading the South African public by stating on its website and in other publications that the Bank is committed to promoting sustainable socio-economic development and improving the quality of life of people in the Southern African development community. Due to the government's actions and methods, there is less development capital available for vital projects that aim to grow the South African economy and infrastructure â€“ this comes down to the looting of tax money. Clearly the R3,5 billion that was allocated to the SAA is a lifeline that is covertly financed by taxpayers. This will decrease the country's chances for economic growth seeing as it is highly unlikely that the bankrupt SAA will be able to pay back the loan. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0']));The FF Plus will hold the relevant ministers accountable so as to put a stop to further looting.
