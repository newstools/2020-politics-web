Maile overreaches again to “strengthen” his weak case 29 January 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0']));Yesterday MEC Lebogang Maile gave vague and very confusing "reasons" for rescinding the decision to suspend the Speaker of the City of Tshwane, Councillor Katlego Mathebe, and the former Speaker of the City of Johannesburg, Councillor Vasco da Gama. According to Maile’s statements, he is “strengthening” his case by withdrawing his previous decision. In doing so, he has conceded that his case was too weak to stand any form of legal scrutiny. Now, the MEC has written to the Chief Whip of the City of Tshwane directing that Council convene urgent disciplinary proceedings. Once again, the MEC is exercising powers he simply does not have. He has no such authority. Neither can Speaker Katlego Mathebe be judged as “insubordinate”. She is not his employee. Therefore, there can be no such thing a insubordination in this case. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','1']));We will continue challenging all moves made by the MEC which are an overreach, a power-grab and blatantly unlawful and unconstitutional. We will not allow the City of Tshwane to be captured by the MEC and his ANC cronies. Issued by Mike Moriarty,Gauteng Provincial Chairperson, 29 January 2020
