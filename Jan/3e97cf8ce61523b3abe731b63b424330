ALERT: DRAFT LAND EXPROPRIATION AMENDMENT BILL HAS BEEN PUBLISHED WITHOUT ADEQUATE PUBLICITY BY PARLIAMENT Tuesday, 31 December 2019 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));The EFF notes that Parliament has published the bill for the amendment of the constitution to give expression to expropriation of land without compensation in the National Gazette for comment. This, however was been done with no adequate publicity and announcement, worse just before Christmas. We call on all South Africans to share the bill far and wide to ensure maximum reach and awareness. We all have 60 days to give public comments. Here is the link, and let us all share it to friends and communities at large: https://dearsouthafrica.co.za/expropriation-bill/ eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));The principle is simple, the constitution must be amended to include a explicit clause that land must be expropriated, without compensation. We invite all progressive peoples, movements, organizations and formations to send comments in support of the expropriation of land without compensation. This is the historic victory we all need as a country for true total decolonisation to occur. Statement issued by the Economic Freedom Fighters, 31 December 2019
