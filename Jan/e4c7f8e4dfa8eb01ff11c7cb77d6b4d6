FF Plus will oppose ANC’s decision regarding compensation with land reform in all possible ways 23 January 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));The decision that was taken at the recent ANC lekgotla, and that was welcomed by President Cyril Ramaphosa, that the executive authority will determine the appropriate compensation in cases of land reform and expropriation without compensation is unacceptable and unconstitutional. The FF Plus will oppose this decision in all possible ways and will not only fight it in the Constitutional Court, but also on international platforms. The decision comes down to the arbitrary deprivation of land. In 2007, there was an attempt to amend the Expropriation Act so as to afford the Minister this power, but at the time the ANC realised that it would be unconstitutional to do so. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_3',113,'0','1']));It is, thus, incomprehensible that the ANC wants to proceed with it now. It serves as proof that expropriation without compensation is just a smokescreen for the hidden agenda of nationalising land in South Africa. Section 17 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations (UN), clearly states that owning property is a universal right and that no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his property.
