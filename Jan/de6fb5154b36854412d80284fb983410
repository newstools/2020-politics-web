DA calls on MEC Maile to intervene to keep Mogale City’s lights on 16 January 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) notes that Eskom has issued a notice to interrupt the bulk supply of electricity to Mogale City Local Municipality. The notice states that Eskom intends to interrupt the bulk supply of electricity to Mogale City with effect from 12 March 2020 due to the municipality’s contravention of the payment conditions. According to Eskom Mogale City owes R119 623 731, 81 for electricity. The municipality has breached its payment obligations to Eskom by failing to pay its debt. It is totally unacceptable for Mogale City not to pay for electricity while it charges and collects revenue from its residents for the supply of electricity. Mogale City is the latest local municipality that will be joining other ANC-led municipalities such as Merafong Local Municipality, Emfuleni Local Municipality and Rand West District Municipality which are battling to pay debt owed to Eskom. The DA calls on the Gauteng MEC for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (COGTA), Lebogang Maile to intervene as a matter of urgency and ensure that bulk supply of electricity to Mogale is not interrupted. We will also be tabling questions in the Legislature to ascertain the reasons why Mogale City has not yet paid money owed to Eskom. It’s high time that MEC Maile prioritize executing his department’s mandate of providing support to municipalities instead of playing political games with municipalities that are being effectively administered by the official opposition.
