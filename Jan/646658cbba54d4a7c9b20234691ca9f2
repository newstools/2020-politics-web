AfriForum writes to Nersa after Tshwane Metro fails to fulfil its duties 22 January 2020 AfriForum directed a letter to Nersa on 16 January 2020 requesting an investigation on why the Tshwane Metro has failed to refund pre-paid electricity consumers who were charged an illegal electricity tariff in 2019. This follows a promise made by the Tshwane Metro to AfriForum during a management meeting, that they would pay back consumers who were affected by the increase. The increase hadn’t been approved by Nersa at the time. The money was supposed to be refunded in November 2019. As stipulated by the conditions of Section 32(1)(b) of the Electricity Regulation Act (ERA), Nersa must, in applicable circumstances, at its own instance or on receipt of a complaint or inquiry relating to the generation, transmission, distribution or trading, investigate complaints if a licensee is involved, of failure to abide by its licensing conditions. AfriForum also sent a follow-up letter to the Tshwane Metro on 14 January 2020 to enquire why the refunds hadn’t been done. The Metro hasn’t given any feedback on this letter as yet. “We’ve given the Metro more than enough time to honour their agreement. They have failed to fulfil their duty, which is why AfriForum, as a civil rights organisation, has to take further steps to ensure the protection of Tshwane Metro citizens’ rights,” says Jaco Grobbelaar, District Coordinator for Greater Pretoria. AfriForum will continue to put pressure on the Metro to ensure residents’ money is refunded. Help AfriForum fight for your rights by becoming actively involved.
