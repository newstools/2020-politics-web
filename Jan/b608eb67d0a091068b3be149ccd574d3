Law Society concerned about allegations at Western Cape Division of the High Court 29 January 2020 The Law Society of South Africa is concerned about the allegations and counter-allegations by  Judge President, John Hlophe and Deputy Judge President, Patricia Goliath, of the Western Cape Division of the High Court, as has been reported in the media. The country can ill-afford this kind of feud that puts the judiciary in question. The judiciary must be seen as totally independent and this matter can create the wrong perception about the impartiality of the judiciary. In the interest of all the stakeholders and the public, we call on the Judicial Service Commission to deal with the matter as expeditiously as possible, as these allegations and counter allegations go to the heart of the independence of the judiciary. We also request the Judges President to have a more inclusive, transparent and uniform appointment process when filling acting vacancies. The LSSA asserts that it is imperative that a more inclusive and transparent appointment process be adopted to counter any potential negative public perceptions. The LSSA urges that the necessary interventions be made to ensure a uniform process for the appointment of acting Judges. Issued on behalf of Mvuzo Notyesi, President of the Law Society of South Africa, 29 January 2020
