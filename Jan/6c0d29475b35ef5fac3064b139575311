AfriForum approaches premier again over Lesufi’s dismissal 23 January 2020 AfriForum will address a second letter to Gauteng premier David Makhura today, in which the civil rights organisation will once again voice its discontent over the ongoing chaos at several Gauteng schools as a result of unplaced or incorrectly placed learners. Several schools had to close their doors on 20 January 2020 out of fear after days of protest marches by unhappy and frustrated parents. This situation unfolded while Panyaza Lesufi, MEC for Education in Gauteng, continue to pretend that his province’s schools aren’t experiencing any problems. AfriForum has been contacted repeatedly by disheartened parents who say they don’t get any support from the Gauteng Department of Education. “We are already in the second week of the first term and there is still unhappiness among parents and schools as a direct result of the online registration and placement system. We can’t have a situation where schools have to close their doors because of chaos caused by the Gauteng Department of Education. Lesufi and his department need to take responsibility for this chaos and discomfort,” says CarienBloem, Manager for Education at AfriForum. “We will also continue to write letters to the premier to make him aware of the problems Lesufi has caused. At some stage he will have to take note of this and take action,” adds Bloem. AfriForum’s broad campaign against Lesufi’s misconduct continues and includes a petition where parents can support the organisation’s calls for his dismissal by means of the website (www.afriforum.co.za/Lesufimoetval), an SMS to 32782 (R1), or AfriForum’s Facebook page. Bloem encourages the public to support AfriForum’s campaign. “We can no longer allow these placement crises and other types of misconduct to continue every year at the expense of the youth. Gauteng’s schools, parents and children deserve better.” Issued by Carien Bloem, Manager: Education, AfriForum, 23 January 2020
