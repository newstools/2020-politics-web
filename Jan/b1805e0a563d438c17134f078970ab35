DA calls on Gauteng Department of Health to make a decision about Kempton Park Hospital 22 January 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) has learnt that the Gauteng Department of Health is considering a range of options with regards to the future of the abandoned Kempton Park Hospital building. This was revealed by the Gauteng MEC for Health, Bandile Masuku in a written reply to the DA questions tabled in the Gauteng Provincial Legislature. According to MEC Masuku, there were three options which included the following: Renovation of the existing hospital and re-opening it as a district hospital; Renovation of the existing hospital as Folateng Hospital and, Demolition of the existing buildings and building a compliant District Hospital. The MEC indicated that the Folateng Hospital proposal was rejected by the private health sector in Kempton Park and a decision was taken to renovate the existing hospital buildings and convert them to a district hospital. The estimated cost for the demolition of the hospital is R127 729 665,36 and the estimated cost for the new District Hospital is R1 569 850 810,52. The DA calls on MEC Masuku to make a decision as a matter of urgency as Tembisa Hospital is struggling to service people from Kempton Park and neighbouring suburbs. If this hospital is refurbished and re-opened it will help to ease pressure at Tembisa and Edenvale Hospital respectively which are currently overcrowded and unable to render adequate health services to our people. Overcrowding at Tembisa Hospital has resulted in the death of the 10 babies which is an example of how the hospital is struggling to cope. I will continue to put pressure on the MEC for Health, Bandile Masuku to ensure that this hospital is revamped and re-opened as people in this area are in dire need of this facility.
