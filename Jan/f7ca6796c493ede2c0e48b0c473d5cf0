NUMSA condemns RTIA for restructuring without consultation 28 January 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0']));The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) condemns the Road Traffic Infringement Agency (RTIA) for restructuring without consulting the union. We have issued a letter to demand that they stop this process immediately because proper processes have not been followed. The matter was taken to CCMA for conciliation but there was no resolution. During conciliation they would not cooperate with the commissioner and they would not disclose the restructuring report done by the private service provider appointed by them to conduct matching and placement in terms of the new structure. We have now applied for Arbitration to resolve this issue. Meanwhile the RTIA continues to undermine this process by advertising new posts in terms of the new structure. We are doubtful whether the Minister of Transport or the former Board has approved the restructuring within the RTIA. Currently there is no board at the RTIA.  It has been close to two years now that RTIA has been without one since the former Board refused to have their term of office extended for a third time.  Their last day in the office was on the 31 July 2018. As a result of this the RTIA is flouting good corporate governance principles because the CEO also acts as the board by assuming section 49 (b) of PFMA responsibilities. We are not sure whether he was officially appointed by the Minister of Transport to discharge section 49 (b) responsibilities or if he is self-appointed. He operates with a committee called the Corporate Service Committee, which he formed himself. We do not know what are the responsibilities of this committee but it reports directly to him. We have written a letter to RTIA demanding the restructuring report, a salary grading report, jobs profiles, a copy of a new structure and the resolutions of the board signed by the former chairperson of the board or the Minister of Transport approving the restructuring at the RTIA. However, the RTIA is refusing to give us these very crucial documents. We have also alerted the Transport Minister and requested his urgent intervention on this matter, and other related issues at RTIA. In our letter we are concerned about the violation of corporate governance principles and we raise concerns that there is no oversight and accountability at the RTIA, since the CEO seemingly accounts to himself. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','1']));Meanwhile, we demand that the RTIA immediately stop the process of shortlisting and interviews of the advertised posts in terms of a new structure until this matter has been resolved at the CCMA. It is of concern to us that the ten advertised posts were done without salary levels and they allow only those ten positions to negotiate salaries, whereas all other 132 staff members of the agency are not allowed to negotiate their own salaries. Aluta continua! The struggle continues!
