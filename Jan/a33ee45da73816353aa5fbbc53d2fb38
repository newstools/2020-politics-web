R70 million state-of-the-art Centurion Primary School in state of disrepair one year after opening 28 January 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng today conducted an oversight inspection at Centurion Primary school in Centurion. The visit was led by Khume Ramulifho, MPL and Cllr Peter Sutton. This R70 million state-of the-art school was officially opened last year. However, after just one year this school is in a state of disrepair. The ceilings in several blocks at the school have collapsed and the Grade One learners that should have been using the classrooms are now combined with the Grade Two learners. The ceilings in some of the classrooms are also broken. There are major structural damages to the walls hence some of the classrooms are not being used. See photos here, here and here. This environment is not conducive for learning and teaching as the safety of the learners and teachers at this school is under threat. This school is just one of many examples of shoddy workmanship and lack of project management skills by the department. Furthermore, this school is an ICT school that is equipped with the latest technology like smart boards but this is not used as the school does not have access to internet. The DA has written to the MEC for Education, Panyaza Lesufi to appoint engineers to the school, so that a proper assessment can be done to determine whether the school is safe to be occupied as some of the structures are disjointed and the ceiling is falling apart. The MEC should also launch an investigation into the contractor and the quality control process. Issued by Khume Ramulifho, DA Gauteng Shadow MEC for Education, 28 January 2020
