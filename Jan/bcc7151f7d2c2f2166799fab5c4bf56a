IEB National Senior Certificate 2019 7 January 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));The 2019 pass rate is 98.82%, comparable to last year’s pass rate of 98.92%. All candidates who passed achieved a pass that is good enough to enter tertiary study at one of the three levels: 89.51% (compared to 90.65% in 2018) of the cohort achieved entry to degree study. 7.91% (compared to 7.33% in 2018) qualified for entry to diploma study. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));1.4% (compared to 0.95% in 2018) achieved entry for study at the Higher Certificate level. [Additional note on subject passes: Maths:  7459 wrote   -      88.4% scored 40% and above; average 64.06% PHSC:  4917 wrote     -     89% scored 40% and above; average 62.01%]eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_7',114,'0','0'])); 11818 full-time and 779 part-time candidates from 227 examination centres across Southern Africa wrote the Independent Examinations Board (IEB) National Senior Certificate (NSC) examinations in October and November 2019. This is an increase from 2018 when there were 11 514 full-time candidates and 858 part-time candidates. Umalusi has monitored all aspects of the 2019 examination process and has declared the results to be fair and valid. There is a clear realisation among IEB learners, their parents and teachers that having the knowledge and understanding that lies behind the results on the certificate is far more important and meaningful for success after one’s schooling. The closing date for the application for re-marking is 13 January 2020 and the results from re-marking will be released on 6 February 2020 subject to approval from Umalusi. Advanced Programmes 2019 The Advanced Programme courses are extension courses in Mathematics, English and Afrikaans. They are available to any learner in South Africa attending either state or independent schools that choose to participate. The assessment has been benchmarked by UK NARIC, the UK equivalent of the South African Qualifications Authority, and is considered equivalent to the UK A-levels. The 2019 performance in AP Mathematics, consisting of 1351 learners from IEB schools and 993 learners in state schools, has been very pleasing with 67.36% achieving a pass above 40%. From a total of 624 learners offering AP English, 93.86% achieved a pass mark of 50% or above; all learners offering AP Afrikaans achieved a mark of 40% and above. Combined Abitur-NSC 2019 The Combined Abitur-NSC is a qualification offered by the German Schools in Cape Town, Johannesburg and Pretoria. The qualification consists of five subjects assessed by the IEB and seven subjects assessed by the German Education authorities. Through this government-to-government agreement, successful learners in the Combined Abitur-NSC are recognised by German education authorities for entry to German universities and by the South African education authorities for entry to South African universities. Of the 71 candidates who offered this qualification, 100% passed with entry to degree study. The IEB sees its involvement with this qualification as a means of keeping South African students in touch with global standards and developments. Background for media The IEB has 11 818 full-time and 779 part-time candidates in Grade 12 in 2019, registered at 227 IEB examination centres across the country, Mozambique, Namibia and Eswatini as follows: Province Number of schools Number of learners Province/Country 2018 2019 2018 2019 Eastern Cape 15 16 581 668 Free State 6 6 158 180 Gauteng 131 106 6674 6839 KwaZulu Natal 38 37 2185 2144 Limpopo 12 13 375 381 Mozambique 1 1 37 33 Mpumalanga 6 6 406 350 Namibia 7 7 195 193 North West Province 5 7 253 269 Northern Cape 2 2 32 52 Swaziland 6 6 298 279 Western Cape 18 20 1178 1207 TOTAL 218 227 12372 12595 The total number of examination venues was 270, which includes centres that deal only with part-time candidates and centres that host more than one examination venue. The Gauteng numbers include learners registered with three distance-learning institutions which have their head offices in Gauteng. These institutions have both full-time and part-time learners who live in areas across the country. They are registered with the distance-learning institution which manages their lesson delivery as well as the assessment requirements, and in Grade 12 these adhere strictly to the NSC requirements and are moderated and verified by the IEB. About the IEB The IEB is an independent assessment agency, separate from State and Provincial examination boards, operating within the constraints of national legislation and provisions of the national quality assurance body, Umalusi. Umalusi has granted the IEB accreditation for the assessment of the National Senior Certificate and adult examinations at NQF Level 1. The IEB offers examinations for client schools at the Grade 12 level, in line with national policy, based on the National Curriculum Statements and using various forms of assessment, including final summative examination and continuous assessment – i.e. orals, practicals and portfolios. The School Section acts in accordance with Umalusi prescriptions and the provisions of Higher Education, using professional educationalists who are practising teachers in the various subject disciplines. These teachers are active members of IEB Subject User Groups which engage with the curriculum and make recommendations on assessment practice based on real school experience. The IEB offers assessments including international benchmarking tests at other levels to participating schools.
