MEC Maile is obsessed with ousting Tshwane Speaker 30 January 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0']));The Democratic Alliance (DA) has full confidence in Speaker Katlego Mathebe’s ability to continue leading the Tshwane Council, and her only fault in the eyes of the opposition is that she is capable. Gauteng Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (COGTA) MEC, Lebogang Maile is making yet another bid to remove Mathebe from her position after his previous attempts failed. The DA notes a letter that Maile wrote to the Chief Whip of Council in the City of Tshwane, Councillor Christo Van Den Heever, instructing him to institute disciplinary action against Mathebe. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));Maile is accusing Mathebe of grave misconduct, dereliction of duty and breaches of the constitution and the Code of Conduct for Councillors. But it is obvious that his accusations are fabricated, as he has failed to come up with any evidence, or indeed give any specific examples, of her supposed wrongdoings. Maile continues to violate the prescripts of the South African Constitution which confers on municipalities the right to govern while limiting the national and provincial governments from impeding those rights. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));His interference in matters of the DA-led City of Tshwane while, neglecting the failing ANC-led municipalities, amounts to unconstitutional interference, bullying, and harassment on the part of the ANC provincial government. Maile is not fit for office and should be removed immediately. Issued by John Moodey, DA Gauteng Provincial Leader, 30 January 2020
