The FF Plus won the ward from the DA. This is the third ward in the North West province that the FF Plus won from the DA in the last six months. Since the 2016 municipal elections, the number of votes for the FF Plus increased with 87,5% while the DA lost 65% of its votes. The FF Plus also succeeded in expanding its support base in the Ward since the 2019 general elections. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','1']));The FF Plus candidate Nico Killian won the ward. Killian is an experienced councillor who will do everything in his power to serve and look after the interests of the residents of Ward 9. The Mamusa municipal council was dissolved by the provincial government and that lead to yesterday's re-election of the municipal council. The residents of the municipal area must put up with the total collapse of service delivery brought about by the ANC. The final results regarding the proportional seats have not yet been made available. Ward 9's results are, however, an indication of how support for the FF Plus is growing in this Municipality. The FF Plus will continue to build on this victory and will offer real workable solutions to residents who are suffering due to poor service delivery. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_7',114,'0','0']));The FF Plus wants to thank every voter who put his / her trust in the party and who yesterday voted for the growing alternative that brings about real change. The increase in support strengthens the party's mandate to promote its policy and serve its voters' interests. Issued by Pieter Groenewald, FF Plus leader, 16 January 2020
