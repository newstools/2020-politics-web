A truck allegedly reversed into a wall that then collapsed on the learners. Committee Chairperson MsBongiweMbinqo-Gigaba said: “This is indeed a sad moment. These learners left home this morning with the sole intention of learning. Their loved ones greeted them, expecting to see them later in the day. Now they will not have that opportunity. I feel their pain.” The learners were five and seven years old. According to reports, a truck delivering food to Lekgolo Primary School crashed into a wall, which then collapsed on the two pupils. Two other pupils were seriously injured and rushed to KgapaneHospital. “I pray for the speedy and complete recovery of the injured learners,” MsMbinqo-Gigaba said. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_3',113,'0','1']));An inquest docket has been opened to investigate the circumstances surrounding the incident. “I urge the authorities in the province to assist the school – learners, educators, families, relatives, support staff – and to provide the necessary psycho-social support and trauma counselling for all who are affected.
