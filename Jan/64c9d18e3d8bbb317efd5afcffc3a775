DA launches petition to remove failing management at Bheki Mlangeni Hospital 19 January 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0']));The Democratic Alliance in Gauteng has today launched a petition to remove the CEO and top management of the failing Bheki Mlangeni Hospital in Soweto. This is because the Gauteng Health Department has failed to hold the top management of the Bheki Mlangeni Hospital in Soweto accountable despite a jobs-for-cash hiring scandal and the hospital being placed on the list of five worst hospitals in Gauteng. There were high hopes when this hospital was opened six years ago - it was a new hospital with a new staff. It is crystal clear that poor management is to blame for the employment scandals and its poor reputation amongst the public. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));Unfortunately, Gauteng Health MEC Masuku has indicated that he wishes to retain Hospital CEO Ruth Mabyana who shares the blame for what has gone wrong. Under Mabyana, there have been 136 disciplinary actions against employees in the past three years, and 6 staff are currently facing disciplinary charges - 5 for irregular appointments and 1 for theft at the hospital. The hospital has a poor reputation amongst Soweto residents who call it AVBOB as so many deaths happen there. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_7',114,'0','0']));We are therefore calling for an entirely new top management that is untainted by past failures.
