Home oxygen delays threaten lives 12 January 2020 I am concerned that slow delivery of home oxygen tanks by a state contractor has reportedly led to a least three deaths in the Riverlea area in west Johannesburg since October last year.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_5',112,'0','0'])); This is according to the Benchmarks Foundation’s local community monitor Charles van der Merwe, who also says that power cuts due to load-shedding and a backlog in gas tank delivery over the festive season imperiled at least seven Riverlea residents dependent on respirators. Last week two people were rushed to hospital, and one is still in a critical condition after not receiving their oxygen tanks in December. Riverlea has a particular problem with lung diseases because of toxic chemicals and dust from nearby mining operations. I suspect that other state patients in Gauteng are also suffering because of delays with delivering home oxygen.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_6',113,'0','0'])); Last year I dealt with a tragic case where a patient at the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Hospital committed suicide after treatment problems that included a late delivery of oxygen. Patients with breathing problems suffer badly even with short oxygen breaks. The Gauteng Health Department needs to urgently investigate why there are problems with the company it contracts to delivery home oxygen to state patients.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_7',114,'0','0'])); Issued by Jack Bloom, DA Gauteng Shadow Health MEC, 12 January 2020
