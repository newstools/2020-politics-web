ANC and EFF chaos sabotages service delivery 30 January 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));The Democratic Alliance (DA) is frustrated, angered and disappointed by the chaos that erupted in the Tshwane Council today which prevented council from conducting its business of approving all mayoral committee reports to serve the residents of the City of Tshwane. This morning, proceedings were brought to a halt yet again, following several disruptions by unruly African National Congress (ANC) and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Councillors. It is ultimately the residents of Tshwane that will suffer because these disruptions are aimed at stopping service delivery, at the expense of the residents. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0']));The DA will now focus its efforts on ensuring that service delivery continues to run smoothly in the City of Tshwane. And for that reason, we need Council to run smoothly sooner rather than later. We want to assure the people of Tshwane that the DA will continue to work tirelessly to bring various political parties together with a goal of approving all reports to ensure service delivery to the  residents of Tshwane who are our first priority. We understand that different parties hold different views, but it is of utmost importance to put those views aside and work together to ensure the service delivery the people deserve. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2',114,'0','0']));Since taking over the DA-led administration in 2016, we worked hard to remove the corrupt system that the ANC left in the City of Tshwane. Furthermore, ratings agency Moody’s has assigned a stable outlook to the City for improving its operating performance, declining debt and rising liquidity, 24 463 EPWP jobs were created, 5400 title deeds were issued, 7900 electricity connections were established and we extended operating hours at Clinics. The ANC and EFF must allow Council proceedings to go ahead, to allow the DA-led City of Tshwane to continue delivering services to the residents.
