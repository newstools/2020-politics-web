Who will be paying for the ANC’s provincial lekgotla, Premier Mokgoro? 23 January 2020 Following our letter to Premier Mokgoro yesterday, the Democratic Alliance (DA) in North West now demands answers regarding the ANC’s provincial lekgotla set to take place from 25-26 January 2020. It is in the interest of the public that Premier Mokgoro comes out clear and announce who will be footing the bill to this extravagance. As previously indicated, the DA will approach the High Court to interdict the lekgotla, should this event continue with the costs carried by municipalities. This follows after an invitation circulated to troikas, municipal managers, members of the mayoral committees, EXCO members and directors responsible for municipal service delivery, explicitly states that accommodation and traveling costs for the 25th and 26th of January are to be covered by municipalities. Paying the accommodation and travelling costs of ANC cadres using state funds is criminal and should be addressed urgently. To this end, we will be sending out letters to all municipalities indicating the dire consequences should they proceed to fund this lekgotla. The DA will pursue every measure at its disposal to hold politicians and officials personally liable for any municipal funds abused for this party-political event. Proceeding with this event at the cost of collapsing municipalities would be a demonstration of the ANC’s contempt for legislation, as well as the people of this province. This is blatant abuse of public funds and we call on Premier Mokgoro break his silence and communicate his plan of action. Issued by Joe McGluwa, DA North West Provincial Leader, 23 January 2020
