EFF CALLS ON ALL EFF STRUCTURES TO HELP IN THE SCHOOLS AND UNIVERSITY REGISTRATIONS Friday, 03 January 2020 The EFF calls on all Branches, Regional Command Teams, Provincial Command Teams, Central Command Team, and all our Public Representatives to help in the registration processes across all schools in our communities. Let no child be turned away from a school because of money, uniform, space, language or racism in general. EFF branches must work with school principals and teachers to ensure that learning material is delivered on time by the department of education. Where there are no books, EFF structures must raise it sharply with the department until books are delivered. Where there are still pit toilets, there must be direct action with the department, until construction starts to eliminate pit toilets. No parent takes their child to die in our schools. We must all protect our schools from agent provocateurs, criminals and other reactionary forces; learning must commence in safe, orderly and resourced schools. We must support all efforts for this to be achieved. Furthermore, we call on the EFF Student Command to do the same in universities and FET institutions. Let no child be tumed away because of finance; let the doors of learning be open for an African child. Statement issued by the EFF, 3 January 2020
