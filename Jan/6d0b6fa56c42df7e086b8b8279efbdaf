AfriForum intends taking legal action following the rejection of emails on expropriation 30 January 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));AfriForum today instructed its legal team to investigate after several people had informed AfriForum that their emails to the parliamentary ad hoc committee on amending the Constitution to provide for expropriation without compensation had been blocked. AfriForum furthermore welcomes the decision by parliament to extend the period allowed for written submissions to the end of February, and the organisation will not only continue its campaign in this regard but will also consider further legal action because of several flaws in the process. In 2018 AfriForum applied for a court order for the Constitutional review committee’s report – recommending that the Constitution be amended – to be set aside because of several irregularities in drawing up the report. This application is due to be heard in court later this year. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0']));According to Ernst Roets, AfriForum’s Head of Policy and Action, AfriForum’s campaign against expropriation will continue both within and outside South Africa. “If the government is unable to collect the public’s inputs without irregularities, it is obvious that the process of expropriating land without compensation is also going to be fraught with irregularities,” says Roets. AfriForum calls on members of the public whose submissions to parliament have been blocked to forward their information to AfriForum at ledesake@afriforum.co.za. AfriForum also encourages people to sign the petition against expropriation at www.onteiening.co.za.
