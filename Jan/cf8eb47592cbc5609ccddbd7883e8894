This comes after two women were shot dead at the Poppy's restaurant in Melville. Six other patrons were wounded and had to be hospitalised. On the same day, 11 people - seven men and four women - sustained gunshot wounds in Mary Fitzgerald Square in Newtown after shots were fired at revellers from what's believed to be the M2 double decker bridge. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));Suspects in both incidents are still not known and a manhunt is underway.

Peters said police were not at liberty to disclose the reward amount. News24eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_7',114,'0','0']));
