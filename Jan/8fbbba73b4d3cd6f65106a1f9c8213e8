Deelpan farm attack could have been prevented 27 January 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));The Democratic Alliance (DA) in North West is saddened by the attack on Derek Mathews and his family on their farm near Deelpan on Saturday evening. Mathews, Vice Chairman of Grain SA, reportedly had a braai with family members when five armed men came into sight. Family members were tied up, assaulted and robbed. This traumatic attack once again puts rural safety in the spotlight and further emphasizes that the ANC has failed rural communities. Not only is the fate of these communities living in fear ignored, but their right to safety is blatantly denied. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));It remains shocking that the ANC government is watching farmers and farm workers being attacked and murdered with such brutality and still does not want to declare rural safety as a priority crime. The failed ANC and SAPS have lost the fight against crime; we need a better trained, better equipped, police force to serve communities. In order to prevent more farmers from leaving the agricultural sector, we must prioritize their safety and thereby ensure that food security is not further threatened. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));The DA is therefore once again calling on the government to set up rural security units and specialized police units to help combat crime. In our role as opposition party, the DA will be tabling a private members bill in the North West Provincial Legislature wherein we will be introducing a plan of action for community safety. The DA will continue to put pressure on the ANC government to protect rural communities, farmers and farm workers Issued byÂ Jacqueline Theologo,DA North West Spokesperson on Agriculture and Rural Development, 27 January 2020eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','0']));
