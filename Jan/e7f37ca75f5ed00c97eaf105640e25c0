DA questions 60 Councillors being guarded by Metro police 29 January 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0']));The DA notes reports that 60 Durban ANC Councillors are being guarded on a 24-hour basis by Metro police. It is alleged that each public representative has a Metro vehicle allocated to them. The DA will write to the provincial treasury to ask for a full cost breakdown. The latest information provided to the Security and Emergency Services Committee showed that in September of last year, 50 Councillors were being protected. There were a further 15 for whom assessments had been lodged. There were 55 vehicles allocated to these Councillors from Security Management Unit. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','1']));The report further stated that there were 96 guards from Security Management Unit and 26 from Metro Police allocated to do this work. This reports did not detail what this was costing the city every month, which we have requested. Whilst we are sensitive that legitimate security threats do exist, these threats need to be carefully weighed up against threats created by political infighting and parties themselves. Ordinary residents of the city face dangerous and debilitating conditions on a daily basis, and should not be suffering whilst Metro Police and security pander to the needs of politicians. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));The DA will continue to investigate these matters and ensure that public monies are not wasted.
