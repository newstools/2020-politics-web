Emfuleni spends over R4.5 million on grave digging 8 July 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[468,60],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0']));The Democratic Alliance (DA) is shocked to learn that the ANC-led Emfuleni Local Municipality has spent over R4.5 million on grave digging. This information was revealed by the Gauteng MEC for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (COGTA), Lebogang Maile in a written reply to the DA’s questions tabled in the Gauteng Provincial Legislature (GPL). According to MEC Maile, Emfuleni has awarded the grave digging contract to Sobangena Trading JV Spinks Trading and Inkokheli Business Enterprise with effect from 24 May 2018 till 23 April 2021. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));Sobangena Trading JV Spinks Trading has been paid R2 266 782.47 and Inkokheli Business Enterprise has been paid R 3 173 397.18. In total, the municipality has paid R 5 440 179.65 for grave digging. MEC Maile states that Emfuleni does not have the capacity to render the grave digging service internally. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));It is worrying that this municipality which is facing a serious cash flow problem continues to outsource services that can be done internally. This money could have been used to buy necessary equipment and tools needed for grave digging as well as creating employment opportunities for the local residents. The DA calls on MEC Maile to clamp down on unnecessary outsourcing in Emfuleni as part of his interventions to save this municipality. We are also calling on MEC Maile to investigate the reasons why this municipality does not have a department which deals with grave digging services.
