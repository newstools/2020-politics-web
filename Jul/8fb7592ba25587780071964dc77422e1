DA welcomes AG investigation of EC 'Scooter Scandal' 21 July 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));The Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomes the news that the Auditor-General of South Africa will be looking into the Eastern Cape Department of Health’s “Scooter Scandal”. The DA has long held the view that this was an unnecessary waste of taxpayers’ money that would have been better spent trying to shore up the province’s meagre defences against the Covid-19 pandemic. Not to mention the fact that these scooters are nothing but undignified, glorified wheelbarrows that not even Eastern Cape Health MEC SindiswaGomba and Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize can agree the original purpose of in an effort to distance themselves from the furor. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));The DA has consistently put pressure on this issue to ensure transparency on this project from its inception. We reiterate that the MEC should be fired immediately and the provincial department should be placed under administration as a matter of urgency. The Eastern Cape is not only suffering the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, it also finds itself in the midst of maladministration and lack of political will to truly turn the province’s misfortunes around and take care of the people trying to carve out a living there.
