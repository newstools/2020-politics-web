Public can comment on 5G policy that will allow use of private land for networks 30 July 2020 Minister of Communications and Digital Technologies Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams has gazetted a new policy on the deployment of communications networks in South Africa. The policy aims to accommodate the accelerated deployment of electronic communications networks, such as LTE and 5G networks. The policy gives mobile networks and other licensees the right to select, enter, and use public or private land for the deployment of their network infrastructure. Any infrastructure built on this land would belong to the network which built it, and property owners are directed to avoid damage to the facilities built on their property. The public has a right to comment on this issue in terms of parliaments public participation process. Rob Hutchison of Dear South Africa explains more about the policy and the effects on South Africa in the interview below. He explains that time is running out for those want to give input into the Prescription in Civil and Criminal Matters (Sexual Offences) Amendment Bill [B 22B-2019]. The proposed amendments to the law will make it possible to prosecute sex offender’s decades after the offences were committed – unlike the existing Criminal Procedures Act which allows for a 20 year window in which to bring prosecutions.
