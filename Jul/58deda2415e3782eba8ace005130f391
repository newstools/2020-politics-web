Alleged child rape at hospital highlights failures in responding to GBV 8 July 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[468,60],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0']));I am horrified at the alleged rape of a two-year-old girl while in isolation for Covid-19 at the Dr George Mukhari Academic Hospital in north western Gauteng. The hospital CEO Dr Richard Lebethe has now claimed that he only heard about this through the media although the incident happened in mid-June. The delays in investigating what happened highlight the failure at various levels to take this seriously. The police are giving poor excuses and the hospital sent the family from pillar to post instead of immediate action. According to the family, the Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit (FCS) has still not contacted them. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));It is difficult to comprehend the evil of someone perpetrating Gender Based Violence (GBV) on a helpless child in an isolation ward because of suspected Covid-19 infection. The investigation by the Gauteng Health Department needs to be concluded soon and real action taken to ensure that justice is seen to be done in this case and extra protections put in to ensure safety of patients in isolation wards.
