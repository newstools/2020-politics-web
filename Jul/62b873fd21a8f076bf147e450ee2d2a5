This means that in some instances, cases could be allocated to the wrong sub-districts. We are working with the sub-districts to clean and verify the data and where errors are picked up locally, cases will be re-allocated to the correct areas. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));More data is available here: https://coronavirus.westerncape.gov.za/covid-19-dashboard The Western Cape has recorded an additional 20 deaths, bringing the total number of COVID-19 related deaths in the province to 2343.

Recoveries: eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_5',115,'0','1']));We are pleased that the Western Cape has recorded almost 60 000 recoveries since the first case of the coronavirus was detected in the province on 11 March. The world  is constantly learning and developing new knowledge about COVID-19 and how to manage this disease. The use of high flow nasal oxygen and of the steroid dexamethasone have emerged as very successful treatment of more severe cases. But despite the advancements in science and medicine which can help to save lives, the most basic rules of hand washing, hygiene, mask wearing and social distancing are still the most effective tools we have to prevent the spread of the virus. Many who contract COVID-19 will experience mild symptoms which could include a sore throat, a fever, a loss of smell and taste, a cough, tiredness and body aches and pains. These can be treated at home, but the person must self-isolate for a period of 14 days to ensure that they do not pass on the virus to their loved ones, their colleagues or to people sharing a space with them on public transport or in other public places. Anyone who starts to experience trouble breathing or shortness of breath during this time, should seek out medical attention. People who fall into the high risk categories which include people over the age of 55, or those with underlying illnesses such as diabetes, hypertension, HIV, or any heart, lung or kidney disease, should also monitor their symptoms closely and take extra precautions. Others may never experience symptoms at all, and could have COVID-19 without ever knowing. This is why it is so vitally important that you continue to wash and sanitize your hands, regularly clean surfaces around your home and workplace, keep your distance from other people, and wear a clean, cloth mask even if you don't feel sick. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-banner-1','ezslot_6',116,'0','0']));Coronavirus will be with us for a long time still and staying home as much as possible, and abiding by the golden rules can help to keep you, and your loved ones safe.
