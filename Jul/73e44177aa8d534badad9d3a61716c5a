DA calls on MEC Lesufi to close schools in Diepsloot until they are properly supplied with water 1 July 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng is calling on Gauteng MEC for Education, Panyaza Lesufi to close down all schools in Diepsloot as a matter of urgency due to the schools not having running water. Diepsloot has been without electricity for about eight days and as a result there is no pressure to pump running water for the schools' toilets and water taps. The water tanks are being delivered to the schools every day however they cannot supply water for the toilets. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));The fact that there is no running water at these schools and that both learners and teachers are unable to use the toilets and wash their hands is unhygienic. This clearly indicates that the schools in the area are not compliant with the school regulation standards of operation during this national lockdown period due to the deadly Covid-19 pandemic. We call on MEC Lesufi to close down schools in Diepsloot as they are not safe and are putting the lives of both our learners and teachers at risk of contracting the Coronavirus. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));The department should also engage with both the City of Johannesburg and Eskom to ensure that electricity is restored, and the water pressure problem is resolved in Diepsloot to ensure conducive learning and teaching environments.
