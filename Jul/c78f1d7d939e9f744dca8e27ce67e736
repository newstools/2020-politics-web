Ndabeni-Abrahams keeps SABC board resignation secret 20 July 2020 Note to Editors: Please find attached soundbite by DA Shadow Minister of Communications and Digital Technologies, Phumzile Van Damme MPeval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0'])); The Democratic Alliance (DA) has it on good authority that South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) board member, Bernadette Muthien resigned last month. The DA has been reliably informed that both President, Cyril Ramaphosa and the Communications and Digital Technologies, Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams are aware of her resignation. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));Despite this knowledge, the Minister who ordinarily informs Parliament of resignations from the entities she is responsible for, has not informed the Committee of Communications and Digital Technologies. In terms of the Broadcasting Act, Parliament is not only the body the SABC reports to, it also appoints and can remove board members from the public broadcaster. That it has not been informed of Ms Muthien’s resignation is yet another example of the disdain for Parliament Minister Ndabeni-Abrahams has been displaying of late. It is unclear what the reasons for Muthien’s resignation are, and the DA will be requesting that she be invited for an exit interview to disclose whether there are any matters that Parliament needs to be aware of that may have caused her resignation. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));History has shown that once resignations from the SABC board begin, it usually means the beginning of strife at the public broadcaster. The DA will not stand by if there are any indications that the SABC may once again the plunged into crisis. If steps can be taken to prevent this, it needs to happen early.
