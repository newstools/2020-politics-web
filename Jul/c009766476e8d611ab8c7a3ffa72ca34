MEC Kegakilwe succumbed to COVID-19 today after a short battle with pneumonia. He was admitted yesterday in a private hospital in Vryburg and was subsequently transferred to Klerksdorp where he suffered a cardiac arrest on arrival. He was a tried and tested leader with an illustrious political career that led to his occupancy of this key position in provincial leadership. It is crushing to lose such talent at the prime of his life. We convey our heartfelt condolences to the family of MEC Kegakilwe as well as his beloved friends, colleagues and comrades. We extend our condolences to all the families, relatives, friends and colleagues who have lost their loved ones. May their souls Rest In Peace.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-banner-1','ezslot_5',116,'0','0'])); Statement issued by Dr Zwelini Mkhize, Minister of Health, 6 July 2020
