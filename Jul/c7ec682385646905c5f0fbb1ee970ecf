This means that in some instances, cases could be allocated to the wrong sub-districts. We are working with the sub-districts to clean and verify the data and where errors are picked up locally, cases will be re-allocated to the correct areas. More data is available here: https://coronavirus.westerncape.gov.za/covid-19-dashboard eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_5',115,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_6',115,'0','1']));The Western Cape has recorded an additional 47 deaths, bringing the total number of COVID-19 related deaths in the province to 2224. We send our condolences to their loved ones at this time. High flow nasal oxygen: One of the ways the Western Cape is treating seriously ill COVID-19 patients in hospitals is with high flow nasal oxygen- which allows doctors to deliver concentrated oxygen to a patient's lungs, without a ventilator. After seeing some positive initial results treating patients early on in the pandemic at Tygerberg, we have expanded the treatment and we now have over 160 high flow nasal oxygen machines available in the province. This treatment is especially important as it does not need to be performed in an ICU setting, and can be administered to patients in acute beds. This week, Groote Schuur Hospital was able to report some excellent news as five patients at the hospital were deemed well enough to be discharged from ICU and high care to regular wards on the same day, after receiving this life-saving care. Not only is this wonderful news for the patients who are on the way to recovery, but it is a reflection of the hard work and dedication of all of the staff at Groote Schuur hospital who are working on the frontlines to ensure that those who need care, are able to access it. I would also like to once again share a message of deep gratitude for all the healthcare workers in this province. These phenomenally dedicated people are a true inspiration as they go and work to save lives on the front lines every single day. We thank you all for everything you do. Mandela Day: Each year, we mark the birthday of our first democratic President, Nelson Mandela, in July by committing to helping others or performing selfless acts for at least 67 minutes. This year, we have already seen so many South Africans embody the spirit of love, sharing and selflessness, helping wherever there was a need, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the vast humanitarian need created by the lockdown. Many of the patients in our healthcare facilities are among our most vulnerable, and we would like to provide them with some warmth and comfort during their stay. You can help by preparing a care package, or donating some of the most needed items such as fleece blankets, socks, toiletries, warm clothing and face masks. You can also include a home made get well soon card, write a poem, or draw a picture that we can give to our patients. Individuals and corporates wanting to get involved, please contact Harry Grainger at The Health Foundation for more information on how to donate: 021 418 1580 / 072 6133 719 You can also drop off your care packs. Carefully label it with “Spreading Warmth” and your name and drop it off at: The Health Foundation offices (16th Floor Norton Rose House, 8 Riebeek Street, Cape Town) Issued by Western Cape Office of the Premier, 9 July 2020eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-leader-1','ezslot_7',118,'0','0']));
