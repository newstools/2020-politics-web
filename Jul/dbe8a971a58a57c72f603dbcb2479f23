We are concerned with the long-term effects of farm attacks on our communities, as it will further exacerbate unemployment and instability of the economy, during a time where Covid-19 is already contributing to many job losses and further poverty. The government does not seem to be willing to fulfill its constitutional obligation of creating conducive and safe environments where private investors and businesses can invest and operate businesses safely in this country. This is a cause for concern, as the number of farm attacks are escalating countrywide. Effective law enforcement is of immediate importance to stop farm attacks and murders. This comes after yet another attack in the same area of Mooi River last night. A couple - Allen Still, a local veterinarian and his wife Isla - were attacked by three men, disguised in balaclava masks, while they were having supper, at around 20h00. The husband is currently being treated for serious injuries at the Life Hilton Hospital. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));This is the third attack on people living on the D161 in Mooi River. Local farmers and businesses are concerned about the safety of people in the District, and are calling for something to be done by the Community Safety Department's MEC. If the continued spike in farm attacks and murders is not addressed, it will not only create more job losses but will also have a serious impact on food security in our country, as these attacks affect food production. Our province is already facing food insecurity and many people live below the poverty line due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Agriculture Sector will continue to lose billions of rands and production if this issue of farm attacks is not dealt with, with the urgency it deserves. We urge MEC for Community Safety and Liaison, Hon Bheki Ntuli, to increase rural patrols by the police and to address the shortage of manpower, as well as police vehicles, in order to curb this scourge of farm attacks and crime in general in the province.
