Rolling blackouts: A miracle that any business survives the ANC  10 July 2020 Eskom implementing stage 2 rolling blackouts from 12:00 today is another death blow to our hemorrhaging economy. Not only will the economy, especially small businesses, have to contend with the debilitating consequences of the ANC’s economic lockdown, they will now also have to weather the storm of the rolling blackouts: it is miraculous that any business survives this ANC government. Just as businesses begin to pick up the pieces after the disastrous economic lockdown, they have been dealt yet another blow. South African businesses are no longer operating in a conducive economic environment where jobs and opportunities are being created. Instead, businesses are desperately trying to survive as they shed jobs in an increasingly hostile economic environment. There’s only one way for South Africa to move away from the devastation caused by Eskom, and that is the Democratic Alliance’s (DA) plan for Eskom to be split into two entities, with a view to partial or full privatisation, and for independent power producers to be brought on board in preparation for a move in this desired direction. Electricity is central to ensuring people’s livelihoods are secured. It is clear that while South Africans can afford electricity, they cannot afford Eskom.
