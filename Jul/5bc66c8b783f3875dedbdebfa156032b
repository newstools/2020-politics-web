SAA Pilots’ Association welcomes government commitment to relaunch SAA 16 July 2020 The SAA Pilots’ Association welcomes the Department of Public Enterprise’s confirmation of the availability of funding for the South African Airways rescue plan. With this funding, the hard work of restoring South African Airways to profitable and sustainable operations can begin. The investment of taxpayer funds in this particularly difficult economic environment is not a sacrifice we take lightly.  A successful exit from this process will mark the beginning of a new chapter for our company, and an opportunity to turn SAA into a profitable, globally competitive airline that is no longer reliant on the fiscus. It is, and has always been, SAAPA's priority to save jobs, to reduce reliance on the fiscus and ultimately, to save the airline. The funding of the business rescue plan and the appointment of a new management and board are equally crucial to this new era in the life of our 86 year old airline. To justify the public investment in SAA, the new fit for purpose management team must prioritise sustainability, profitability, good governance, transparency and accountability. SAAPA has attempted to proactively engage and collaborate throughout the business rescue process. We are ready to share our ideas and plans with the new management team and look forward to discussions in the best interest of the airline, the fiscus and the employees of SAA. We will continue to engage with all willing stakeholders to create a robust business model and an improved plan for the future of SAA. Together we can make SAA a world-class airline.
