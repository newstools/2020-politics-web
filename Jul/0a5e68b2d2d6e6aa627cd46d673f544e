DA Federal Council adopts proposal for virtual Congress The Democratic Alliance’s Federal Council today resolved to hold a virtual Federal Congress over two days, on 31 October and 1 November 2020. The vote in favour of holding a virtual Congress was supported by an overwhelming majority following a lengthy discussion on a range of aspects, including technical issues impacting on-line voting. In preparation for the Congress, the Party’s professional staff will undertake an audit of the personal circumstances of every delegate, to make certain that each one is able to maximally participate in terms of the regulations covering the “risk adjusted strategy” that may then be in force.
