DA welcomes establishment of tribunal into allegations against Judge Hlophe  6 July 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomes the establishment of a tribunal to investigate allegations of gross misconduct against Western Cape Judge President, John Hlophe. This is a crucial and necessary step to ensure that the Judiciary is not stained by any individual’s alleged abuse of power and that our courts remain custodians of the Constitution and the rule of law. We cannot afford to allow a situation where the independence of the courts is brought into question, and we trust that the establishment of the tribunal in the matter involving Judge Hlophe will restore the credibility, and independence of the Judiciary, and increase public confidence in the courts. The DA wants to make it clear that our views and assessment of Judge Hlophe’s conduct is guided by our respect for the rule of law and the independence of the Judiciary. These are among the most fundamental and central values enshrined in the Constitution. The DA has consistently held the view that where sufficient prima facie evidence exists to warrant an investigation into serious matters involving the courts, such allegations must be swiftly investigated in order to restore decorum in our courts. We further call for the suspension of Judge Hlophe in light of his long and tainted history of alleged misconduct and until such time that the tribunal has conducted its work and have made its recommendations. A proper investigation into these allegations can only happen in his temporary absence from office. The DA hopes that the tribunal will be given the space to carry out its duties, we can only build a prosperous nation when all arms of government are strengthened and do their work without fear or favour.
