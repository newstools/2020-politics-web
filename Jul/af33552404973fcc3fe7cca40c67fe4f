SA Express (SAX) workers respond to DPE’s media statement 20 July 2020 The SA Express Workers wish to state theirdisappointment with the media statement DPE released on 10 July 2020.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0'])); The media statement makes reference to the R1.2 billion that wasallocated to the airline. In the statement, the DPE alludes to the factthat they have no knowledge of what the airline utilised the funds for. The SAX Workers wish to put it on record that the funds were releasedwith conditions attached, as per communication from DondoMogajane, DGof National Treasury dated 23 October 2018. The key condition was thatthe funds only be utilised to repay SA Express Government guaranteeddebt. This was actioned and communicated to the DPE in a letter dated 13March 2019. For the department to keep on mentioning that the funds weremeant to address the airlines “solvency and liquidity problems” isfactually incorrect as the funds had to be channelled to specificsuppliers only. The SAX Workers therefore find it disingenuous that the DPE is now notaware of what the funds got utilised for.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0'])); The matter of the rampant corruption that took place at SA Expresshappened under the DPE watch - they appointed the Board and CEO’s andratified the appointment of the Executive. It is therefore shocking thatthey now throw this at the workers' faces when they took no action tostop the corruption and looting when it was taking place.The SAX Workers have engaged with the DPE and proposed that they beoffered retrenchment packages and the salary owed to them, workers lastreceived their salary in February 2020. The workers are still waitingfor a tangible response from DPE and feel that they are being punishedfor the mismanagement of the airline under the department's leadership. The workers appeal to DPE to engage in good faith and not punish them byrehashing the facts that have been in the public domain to justify theill-treatment. The workers’ plea is to be treated fairly just like theSAA employees and be let go with dignity – pay salary owed andretrenchment packages.
