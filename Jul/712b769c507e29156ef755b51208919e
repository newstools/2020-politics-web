Procurement Disclosure Report a commitment to clean governance We are pleased to publish the first edition of the Procurement Disclosure Report by Provincial Treasury. The Procurement Disclosure Report details all personal protective equipment (PPE) procurement and expenditure in the Western Cape in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, in a regular and standardised report that will be made available on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis to the public. The first Procurement Disclosure Report details all PPE procurement and expenditure by Western Cape government departments from 1 April 2020 to 30 June 2020 and, on each transaction, includes details such as the name of the supplier, a description of the item, the unit price per item and the total spent. Minister of Finance and Economic Opportunities, David Maynier, said: “We consider the Procurement Disclosure Report an excellent example of transparency, and another innovative step towards maintaining clean government in the Western Cape. We have invested significant amounts of money on PPE in the fight against Covid-19 in the Western Cape, and so I am pleased that this initiative by Provincial Treasury as an important measure designed to mitigate the risks in supply chain management and ensure this money is spent correctly.” Provincial Treasury, Head of Department, David Savage, added: “The public Procurement Disclosure Report enhances transparency in our supply chains by providing procurement information that is easy to access and meaningful to all interested parties and oversight bodies. Because we use different supply chain management systems with varying lead and lag times, we hope that this consolidated report will eliminate duplication and discrepancies in reporting.” Other pro-active support and compliance measures implemented by Provincial Treasury to mitigate procurement risks include the establishment of a Central Procurement Advisory Committee to support and advise the main procuring departments and enhanced surveillance of disaster-related procurement by internal audits of procurement transactions.

In our continued commitment towards clean governance and transparency, the Provincial Treasury is pleased to publish the first edition of the Procurement Disclosure Report. This report details all personal protective equipment (PPE) procurement and expenditure in the Western Cape from 1 April 2020 until 30 June 2020. Going forward an automated report will be made available on the Provincial Treasury website on a monthly basis. The next report will be available on 31 August 2020. Background This first edition of the Procurement Disclosure Report is a proactive initiative by the Provincial Treasury to provide the public, oversight bodies and other interested parties with useful information on public procurement activities related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The initial focus of this report is on Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), but this will be incrementally expanded as additional information becomes available. National Treasury Instruction Note 1 of 2015 requires the publication of the following information in respect of contracts awarded: Contract description; Bid number; Names of successful bidder(s); Preference points claimed; Contract Price(s), Contract period (if possible); Name of Directors; and Date of commencement. Access this instruction note here: This Procurement Disclosure Report includes the following information sets: PPE items procured by each Department, including associated costs; Unit cost; Total cost; Supplier(s) name; Total payment to supplier(s) This information is extracted from various procurement systems, except for term of contract and contract commencement date.

All interested parties and oversight bodies can now access procurement information through this report. It is a valuable source of information that supports the important work done by oversight bodies and will strengthen good governance within the Western Cape. The Procurement Disclosure Report simplifies reporting by combining procurement data collected from various sources and eliminating duplication and discrepancies that result from lead and lag times of various systems in capturing procurement transactions. This report seeks to provide accurate, relevant, meaningful and credible information, presented in a user-friendly and accessible document. Reporting Methodology The information in this report is drawn from various systems, including the Departmental Bids Awarded Registers; the LOGIS provisioning system, the ePS procurement system for quotations (now used for formal bids during the emergency dispensation), and the BAS payment and accounting system. This information is then matched and verified against the National Treasury’s Central Supplier Database (CSD) and the Western Cape Supplier Evidence Bank, with respect to supplier information. Supplier information is then correlated with government personnel information system (PERSAL) to ensure there is no conflict of interest for state employees doing business with the state. It is further validated against the National Treasury’s register for tender defaulters. Report Glossary Payment Quantity – The number of items purchased Last Unit of Measure – The size, volume or composite quantity of items Average Unit Price – Average cost per individual unit paid by the Department Date of Applicable NT Price – To cross reference National Treasury (NT) benchmark prices, this date must be used Payment Amount – Total amount that was paid to the supplier for a particular purchase National Treasury Benchmark Pricing The National Treasury issued four different iterations of benchmark pricing for the disclosure period. Since different benchmark prices are applicable at different times, depending on the order date, this report only references the applicable benchmark date to enable the cross-referencing that may be required.
