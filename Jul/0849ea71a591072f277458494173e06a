DA condemns in strongest terms organisations that are advocating for schools to close due to increasing Covid-19 cases in Gauteng 14 July 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0']));The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng condemns in the strongest terms the organisations that are intending to shut down schools across the province. This is aimed at gaining publicity at the expense of learners. The reasons being provided by these organisations on why they want schools to be closed are not based on any expert advice but are intended to instil fear amongst parents, learners, and teachers. The DA strongly believes that only the schools without the necessary Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) and basic services must not operate until they have all the necessary required equipment and resources to ensure that they adhere to the standard health regulations. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));The Gauteng Department of Education has an obligation to ensure the safety of both learners and teachers during this national lockdown period as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. The department should ensure that it provides quality basic education to all children of school going age. It is unfortunate that in most cases people who are advocating for schools to close have access to home schooling and online platforms. While other learners mostly from underprivileged areas who attend quintile 1 to 3 schools benefit from attending school as they do not have access to online platforms as they cannot afford to buy data, portable phones and access to reliable networks. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));This is the time to deal with inequalities instead of widening the gap to the advantage of the privileged. We do note the increasing number of Covid-19 daily cases, and as the country is not on hard lockdown schools are safer places for many learners who are roaming the streets doing nothing. We urge principals to ensure that they follow the regulations and implement standard operating procedure when there is positive case reported. Learners who are back at schools are settling in well and learning and teaching is continuing under these new normal conditions. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_5',115,'0','1']));We urge parents not to be misled by these organisations who want to close down schools. The DA will continue to monitor teaching and learning during this difficult period and ensure that the department provides all our schools with all the necessities required to ensure the safety of our learners and teachers.
