NW Agriculture’s defective implementation plan leaves farmers without financial aid 15 July 2020 Note to editors: Find attached soundbites in English and Afrikaans by DA Northwest spokesperson on Agriculture and Rural Development, Jacqueline Theologo. The Democratic Alliance (DA) in North West has written to the MEC for Agriculture and Rural Development, DesboMohono, requesting a detailed report on the implementation of the Covid-19 Disaster Agricultural Support Fund. The Department’s progress report on the R69 million relief funding recently presented to the North West Provincial Legislature’s Portfolio Committee on Agriculture, revealed that only 34.54% of applications have been approved. More than 8 000 farmers submitted their applications within the prescribed time period accompanied by the necessary statements, but almost 6 000 was sent away empty handed. The Smallholder and Communal farmers had to submit the following: 7-page application form; eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));Bank statements of the past 6 months; Turnover between R50 000 - R1 million; GPS Co-ordinates; eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_5',115,'0','1']));Farm registration number; The number of jobs created; Summary of what is applied for; Indication of support that is needed; and Compliance declaration to all acts and regulations. The Department was however unclear on the qualifying criteria and also failed to specify the amounts that will be paid to applicants or on what basis this amount will be determined. From our engagements with farmers who applied, the uncertainty about the amount that will be paid and the timeframe of such payment, was evident. One farmer from the Dr Kenneth Kaunda District has, despite the extension of the timeframe by another 30 days, still not received his voucher. Another farmer from the Kagisano-Molopo District received a meagre R3500, others received R50 000, while the majority have not received any payment. It is baffling that the Department succeeded in making “erroneous” payments to 55 government employees, but are unable to pay the farmers to which the funding is due. We will write to the Auditor-General to investigate the matter to ensure that losses suffered are, where possible, recovered and also to refer suspected material irregularities for further investigation. The Covid-19 pandemic plunged countless farmers into dire financial straits and their inability to produce, poses an immediate threat to food security. MEC Mohono should announce a comprehensive plan, followed by urgent action to assist farmers in need. The livelihoods of rural communities should be protected to avoid further job losses in the agricultural sector. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-leader-1','ezslot_6',118,'0','0']));The MEC should indicate how those farmers who did not qualify for relief funds will be assisted through the Department’s Annual Performance Plan and adjusted budget.
