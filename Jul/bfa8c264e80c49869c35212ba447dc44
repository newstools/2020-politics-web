This follows tension between the illegal land invaders and the rightful property owners after the illegal occupants were legally removed and their structures destroyed following a court order in favour of the rightful property owners. It is alleged that the illegal land invaders have been protesting despite being forcefully removed from the properties that they illegally invaded. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0']));It is also alleged that the rightful property owners are now being intimidated and threatened with petrol bombs by the protesters. We condemn in the strongest terms any form of violence and lawlessness by the protesters. Land invasion is illegal and can no longer be tolerated. eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_4',114,'0','0']));It is high time that the law enforcement agencies act against the criminal elements that are being demonstrated by these lawless protesters. We also urge the rightful property owners to report any incidents of intimidation to the police and not to take the law into their own hands. The DA calls on MEC Mazibuko to protect the rightful landowners and their properties as their lives are at risk and their safety is under threat. The only solution to these illegal land invasions is for government to ensure that they deliver the houses that they promised our people.
