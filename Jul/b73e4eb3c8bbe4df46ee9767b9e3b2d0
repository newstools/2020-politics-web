Report on Weekly Deaths in South Africa In the context of the emerging COVID-19 pandemic, it has become essential to track the weekly number of deaths that occur. Deaths recorded on the National Population Register are provided to the SAMRC on a weekly basis. These have been scaled up to estimate the actual number of deaths by accounting for the people who are not on the population register and the under-registration of deaths. The estimated numbers are compared with the number that would be expected based on the historical data from 2018 and 2019. The number of deaths of persons 1-year and older are reported because birth registration was put on hold during lockdown stage 5 affecting the number of infant deaths recorded on this system. The start date of each week is represented on the graph. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0'])); ***  *** eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0'])); ***  eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_4',114,'0','0']));View the latest report Weekly Report for 1 Jan – 21 July 2020 Estimated Natural Deaths of Persons 1+ Years (Excel spreadsheet) Estimated number of excess natural deaths of persons 1+ years by province and metro, South Africa 2020eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_9',115,'0','0'])); Region Excess deaths 6 May - 21 July South Africa 22,279 Province Eastern Cape 6,411 Free State 752 Gauteng 6,620 KwaZulu-Natal 2,632 Limpopo 527 Mpumalanga 627 Northern Cape 164 North West 566 Western Cape 4,133 Metropolitan Municipality Buffalo City 847 City of Cape Town 3,271 Ekhuruleni 2,033 Ethikweni 673 Johannesburg 2,462 Mangaung - Nelson Mandela Bay 1,316 City of Tshwane 865 Issued by the SAMRC, 29 July 2020
