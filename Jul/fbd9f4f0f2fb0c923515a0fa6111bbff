Following the suspension of operations in parts of Khayelitsha and Bardale earlier this week due to violent protests, Eskom has taken the decision to withdraw operations from Bloekombos, Wallacedene and Kraaifontein CBD, as well as Wesbank in Delft on Wednesday, 22 July 2020. In Kraaifontein, staff members managed to escape unharmed when the Eskom branded vehicle they were travelling in was pelted with rocks by violent protestors. Protest action in Wesbank has also forced Eskom to withdraw its operators. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));This follows two separate incidents on Monday, 20 July 2020, when a vehicle was stoned in Bardale and another stoned and set alight in Khayelitsha, which forced Eskom to withdraw operations in these areas. The ongoing protest action across Cape Town is posing a significant threat to the safety of field operators working in these communities. The safety of employees is Eskomâ€™s top priority and only when these areas are declared safe, will operations resume. Eskom is working closely with the local SAPS and Eskom Security Services to ensure the safety of its staff, while working in these areas. Engagement is also taking place with community leaders to find solutions to the situation. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_4',114,'0','0']));We emphasize our call to the communities to support Eskom and report incidents by contacting the Eskom Toll-Free Crime Hotline 0800 11 27 22 or SMS Crime Line on 32211.
