DA calls on Minister Patel to protect key witnesses in NLC investigation 23 July 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) calls on the Minister of Trade, Industry and Competition, Ebrahim Patel, to coordinate with the Minister of Police, Bheki Cele, to ensure that all key witnesses that are involved in ongoing investigations into the National Lotteries Commission (NLC) and its associated projects, have their safety prioritised and their lives protected from criminal elements. This call follows after I was informed on Wednesday that two key witnesses linked to an ongoing investigation into the NLC’s Denzhe Primary Care debacle were victims of arson in the past week. Both Ado Krige and Takalani Tshikalange had their cars set alight, with the same modus operandi employed, last week Saturday and this week on Wednesday, respectively. See attached images here and here.  ***  This seems to be more than a mere coincidence as they are both key witnesses in a case of NLC grant funding gone wrong, where R27.5 million, which was meant for a drug rehabilitation centre, was stolen and the associated NGO hijacked. They have also provided sworn affidavits to the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition (DTIC) investigating team who are currently looking into the Denzhe Primary Care debacle as well as three other projects per Minister Patel’s instruction. While the DA does not want to pre-empt any outcome of the SAPS and any other relevant law enforcement agency’s work, we call on them to ensure that the investigation into these matters is expedited.
