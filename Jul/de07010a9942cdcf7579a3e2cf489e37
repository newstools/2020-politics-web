This means that in some instances, cases could be allocated to the wrong sub-districts. We are working with the sub-districts to clean and verify the data and where errors are picked up locally, cases will be re-allocated to the correct areas. More data is available here: https://coronavirus.westerncape.gov.za/covid-19-dashboard eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_4',114,'0','0']));The Western Cape has recorded an additional 38 deaths, bringing the total number of COVID-19 related deaths in the province to 2654. We send our condolences to their loved ones at this time. Brackengate accepts first patients: Our Brackengate temporary hospital accepted its first patients today, making it the province's third field hospital to open. Ten people were admitted to the 338 bed facility this afternoon, with the first patients receiving a heartwarming welcome and round of applause from the hospital team at the door. This facility, like the CTICC Hospital of Hope, provides intermediate care to patients who require hospitalisation and oxygen, but who are not critical. The facility is equipped with oxygen at each bed, and a further eight beds fitted for high flow nasal oxygen. It is also paperless and has wifi connectivity so patients can connect to their loved ones at home.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_3',115,'0','0'])); We wish all of those who enter through its doors well as they recover. We also extend our thanks to the many people including Health Minister Nomafrench Mbombo and Minister of Transport and Public Works BonginkosiMadikizela, to the officials and the healthcare workers who have ensured that we have been able to provide healthcare services to the people of the Western Cape, with just a short time to prepare. Comorbidities: The Department of Health in the province has conducted another comprehensive analysis of the comorbidities associated with COVID-19 related deaths in the province. Diabetes and hypertension remain the leading comorbidities in the 2181deaths in people over the age of 20 in the Western Cape as at July 8. Diabetes was a comorbidity in 1042 of these deaths, and hypertension in 1086 deaths. In almost a quarter of these deaths (513), patients had three or more comorbidities. The data also reveals the following other comorbidities: 68 (cardio vascular disease) 277 (chronic pulmonary disease) 35 (cancer) 274 (HIV) 66 (TB current) 233 (TB previously) 99 (other comorbidities) *Numbers will not add up several people had more than one comorbidity When looking at the age breakdowns, the greatest number of deaths were recorded in people over the age of 50. Of the 2181 deaths: -673 were over 70 years of age -573 were aged between 60 and 69 -512 were between the ages of 50 to 59. These numbers show that it is vitally important that anyone who falls into these risk groups take every precaution to protect themselves. This means staying at home as much as possible, and ensuring that if you are on any medication, that you continue to take this. Always wear a mask outside of your home, practice social distancing and wash your hands regularly. Avoid touching surfaces or your face. If you do fall into one of these risk groups and you are experiencing symptoms such as a sore throat, fever, cough, or loss of taste and smell, it is best to get tested early, to ensure that you receive the appropriate care early on. And while the risk of death is lower for younger people and those without comorbidities, anyone who falls into these groups can still become ill, or infect someone who has a much higher risk profile. Each death we record in this province is one too many. We must avoid seeing these deaths only as statistics. Each of these lives had value, these are people who had families and loved ones, aspirations, stories to share and lessons to teach. We must acknowledge their humanity and ensure that we do everything in our power to protect others and save lives. Acts of human kindness: I would like to acknowledge the staff at Helderberg Hospital for going beyond the call of duty and helping to make the birthday of a COVID-19 patient special. Being in hospital at this time can be a very lonely experience as visitors aren’t allowed, but Mrs Wilhelmina Williams, still got to celebrate her 65th birthday with cake and balloons last week thanks to the kindness of some healthcare workers. I would also like to wish Mrs Williams a belated happy birthday and a speedy recovery. Over the past week, I have joined forces with the Maskathon challenge to collect mask donations for Mandela Day. I am pleased to say that we have managed to collect pledges for over 23 500 masks. Some people have supported local mask makers, others have made cash donations while others have lovingly handcrafted masks. I would like to thank all of those businesses and individuals who have answered the call to donate, and help to make a difference in our communities. Anyone still wishing to donate can do so by going to https://maskathon.co.za/masksformadiba/. Issued by Western Cape Office of the Premier, 20 July 2020
