Gauteng Premier is Covid-19 positive: People of Gauteng must act responsible as virus is spreading 10 July 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[468,60],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0']));The FF Plus was sorry to hear that the Gauteng Premier, David Makhura, tested positive for Covid-19 and is experiencing mild symptoms. The party wishes him a speedy recovery. The Premier's positive status indicates that the virus is spreading through Gauteng at an alarming rate. The FF Plus wants to encourage the people of Gauteng to adhere to the health and safety protocols of wearing masks and washing their hands regularly to break the chain of infection. Now that there is more freedom to move around and the government can no longer police the public, the onus rests on every individual in the province to do the right thing and consider others. Since the period of lockdown commenced, Makhura took the initiative to hold a virtual meeting with the party-political leaders in the Gauteng Legislature every week to listen to their concerns and provide feedback on the provincial government's strategy for dealing with the pandemic. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));And although the FF Plus did not agree with all the decisions that were made, the forum offered the party an opportunity to raise concerns regarding various crises that were addressed and resolved as a result. For example, the issue of the centralisation of food aid distribution was dealt with on the forum after which the acting MEC for Social Development, Panyaza Lesufi, abandoned his centralist approach. And after the intimidation of Cradle of Hope in Krugersdorp was discussed, the Premier himself stepped in to enable the institution to once again freely distribute food aid to those in need. The consultative platform that the Premier created ensured that many people's problems could be heard and solved and the FF Plus gives the Premier credit for this initiative. The FF Plus calls on everyone in Gauteng to act responsibly and to protect each other against the virus.
