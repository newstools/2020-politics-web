AfriForum requests Public Protector to investigate funding of Andile Ramaphosa’s COVID-19 project 28 July 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0']));The civil rights organisation AfriForum today directed a written request to Busisiwe Mkhwebane, the Public Protector, to launch an enquiry into the R6 million that the non-profit company Supplier Development Initiatives had received. The company was co-founded by Andile Ramaphosa, the son of President Cyril Ramaphosa, to modify Gauteng minibus taxis to comply with COVID-19 regulations. “Due to recent revelations of government corruption and looting of COVID-19 relief funds, it is in the public’s interest to establish whether Andile Ramaphosa received government support for this project and if this amounts to corruption. AfriForum requested the public protector to investigate the matter on behalf of its members and the public’s interest. If him being the son of the President played any role in Supplier Development Initiatives receiving government funding, it may amount to corruption and must therefore be investigated,” says Monique Taute, Head of AfriForum’s Anti-corruption Unit. “South Africa faces an ongoing struggle with corruption. It has become a national crisis, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. A swift and prompt response is necessary. The ANC’s stated commitment to rooting out corruption seems to be nothing more than mere lip service,” says Taute.
