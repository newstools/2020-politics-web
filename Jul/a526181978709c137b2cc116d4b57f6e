Story of hope: Zintle Peter, a People Management practitioner, did not expect to contract COVID-19, as she is office-based. “I tested positive on 19 May. I am not sure where I contracted the virus, as I am office based and would do minimal shopping on my way home,” she says. eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_8',115,'0','0']));Although she had flu symptoms, she did not think it was serious. “I was in the office and had a query with one of the doctors. In our conversation I mentioned that I was feeling flu-ish. I remember telling her that I didn’t think it was serious.  When I explained my symptoms were loss of taste and smell, she was convinced I may have COVID-19 and recommended I do a test.  I did so, and three days later received my results and was told that I tested positive.” Zintle says she was scared and had to prepare herself mentally for the possibility that she might have COVID-19. “While waiting for my results at home, I remember being very scared. I couldn’t sleep because of fear and kept thinking about what would happen to me and how I would cope. What if I was one of the individuals that would die? But by the time I received the news, I was ready”. She spoke to her healthcare worker for advice on isolating at home. “I was given guidance about isolation and the use of utensils. I share a house with my cousin and daughter, aged seven.  My cousin has a comorbidity, so it was important that we had to talk through what we needed to do as a family.  We made arrangements as to how we would sleep, and move around the house. We also ensured that we cleaned and sanitised constantly,” says Zintle. Zintle experienced headaches and chest congestion. She explains that dealing with her mental health was just as important as dealing with her physical health. “This experience taught me that my mental state was most important for me to deal with.  My friends and family were very worried about me.  I asked myself, how will I manage this virus?  I reminded myself that if I were to pity myself and cry or give up, it would change nothing.  I therefore chose to remain positive, and have an attitude of overcoming this virus.  The support received from my family and neighbours was huge. I felt I had to tell neighbours, so that they could be informed, as they would notice supplies were dropped at the door and so that they would therefore understand.  My neighbours were very helpful and thereafter would call and ask if anything was needed.  I had a case Manager from our substructure that called frequently to check on symptoms, and I appreciated that a lot.” She says staying positive is important in overcoming the virus. “I want to tell people that the most important thing to do besides treating your body, is to treat your mind, because if your mind is positive, you can fight it.  People must ensure that they take care of themselves and take all the necessary precautions.” Previous: Update on the coronavirus by Premier Alan Winde 24 July 2020 As of 1pm on 24 July, the Western Cape has 11 785 active cases of COVID-19, with a total of 88 499 confirmed cases and 73 897 recoveries.

We send our condolences to their loved ones at this time. School closures: The Western Cape Government is concerned that the school closures announced last night by President Cyril Ramaphosa will have a greater negative impact on children's safety than if they were to go to school. We believe that the announcement is not based on scientific evidence and reasoning. As a province, we pride ourselves on having responded to the pandemic in a way that is both data-led and evidence driven. We understand that for many parents, sending their children to school results in a lot of fear and anxiety. The Western Cape Government and our teachers have worked hard to ensure that those parents who do choose to keep their children at home are able to do so. But for many other parents, sending their children to school is the only option and the closure will impact these children the hardest. Many parents who have returned to work will struggle to find safe spaces for children who are not at school over this period, putting them at risk of injury, accidents or abuse. At a time when the economy is under significant strain and we are facing an unemployment crisis, many of these parents cannot afford to stay at home for four weeks. The closure may also impact children who rely on the meals they receive at school. While the Western Cape is the only province to have continued to feed learners throughout the lockdown period, and while schools were closed, we know that it is easier for children to access meals when they are attending schools daily. In the face of major food security threats across the country, these daily meals are essential for many children. Additionally, daily stimulation and learning is necessary to ensure that our children do not fall behind. For many working parents, home schooling, and at home learning activities like reading, are not possible. Most impacted will be poor learners who don't have access to online learning materials and the internet to continue to learn during this time. As Minister of Finance and Economic Opportunities David Maynier outlined in his adjustment budget yesterday, the Western Cape Department of Education has been allocated R310 million in funding to procure protective equipment and to sanitise schools. We have also seen schools across the province put in every effort to ensure that children are safe. We can all help to slow the spread and ensure that we keep ourselves, and our loved ones safe by washing our hands, regularly cleaning down surfaces and high traffic areas in our homes and workplaces, correctly wearing a mask so that it covers both the nose and mouth, and social distancing whenever we leave home.

We send our condolences to their loved ones at this time. Hotspot strategy focused on changing behaviour to slow the spread: The hotspot strategy was implemented to reduce the numbers of infections in places where they were highest. This strategy has involved an all of government approach, with assistance from local municipalities, businesses, civil society and individuals. We know that when we work together as partners we can achieve much more in slowing the spread Covid-19 and saving lives. --Case management: Community healthcare workers continue to be an important part of the strategy, conducting home screenings and paying special attention to high risk groups and diabetics. In the Cape Winelands hotspot for example, screening and testing has been conducted in homes for the elderly and protocols and guidelines, and other support have been provided. While in Klipfontein and Mitchell's Plain, the hotspot teams have conducted compliance checks at old age homes and SASSA paypoints, and provided protocols and support to homes for the elderly and the disabled. Our tracking and tracing has been bolstered by bringing on board the Western Cape Government call centre and by the roll out of the national government’s COVID Connect digital system, which was piloted in the province. So far we have made over 11 700 direct calls to people using our call-centre. We continue to focus on the importance of quarantine and isolation facilities in each hotspot, and have been communicating extensively in all of our hotspot areas. These facilities have supported 4514 people since the start of the pandemic. There are currently there were a total of 411 people in isolation and 195 in quarantine in sites in both the metro and rural facilities. --Civil compliance and behaviour change: The coronavirus will still be with us for a number of months to come and our focus has been on shifting behaviours to ensure that we are able to slow the spread of the virus and protect residents. We need to learn to live with this “new normal”. This focuses on all aspects of life- from individual actions like mask wearing and social distancing to business compliance, transport options and communications campaigns. One of the major behaviours emerging in many of our hotspots is the issue of mask wearing. In some cases, masks are not being worn. We have also seen masks being worn incorrectly. We have therefore now focusing on massive mask drives across our hotspots. Mask donations will be shared in these hotspots to ensure that more people have access. Minister of Cultural Affairs and Sport, Anroux Marais this week launched the mask activation for the Tygerberg and Northern districts, which will take place weekly in these areas. She received 1500 masks donated by Old Mutual which will be distributed through the Department’s Treasure Box @home learning packs so that parents and care givers can also have access to masks. In the Klipfontein and Mitchells Plain hotspots, 1623 masks were donated by Agriculture, to be distributed to urban farmers and farm workers in the City of Cape Town. We are also focused on the management of crowds and people in public spaces. In the Overberg, Overstrand law enforcement have conducted over 100 inspections at taxi ranks, conducted over 200 shop compliance checks, and conducted social distancing checks at municipal buildings. In Khayelitsha, the Chrysalis graduates deployed earlier have been bolstered by neighbourhood watch groups. Earlier this month, 15 neighbourhood watch groups received training and kits, which include sanitisers, masks and tape, to mark out social distancing lines, to help them enforce compliance in their neighbourhoods. In the Eastern region, eight neighbourhood watches will be deployed in Mfuleni. In Klipfontein and Mitchells Plain, metro police are conducting compliance checks at schools, shops and malls, clinics, churches and civic centres. EPWP workers have also been deployed for queue management at clinics in these areas and in Atlantis in the Western sub-district. Also in the Western sub-district, 16 barbershops and 91 spaza shops were surveyed for COVID-19 compliance in DuNoon, and inspections were conducted in 10 Langa schools. In the Southern sub-district, 32 hairdressers and barber shops were inspected for compliance, and educational materials shared with them. Informal traders and spaza shops are being supplied with business safety kits by the City of Cape Town and the Western Cape Government, which contain sanitisers, masks, and posters and pamphlets to display in store and share with their customers. In Overstrand, taxi ranks, the main shopping centre and the sidewalks are regularly disinfected, while in Theewaterskloof, open areas like taxi ranks and public toilets are disinfected each Friday. New communications methods are being used in addition to our radio, print, social media and street pole campaigns.  These include branding of taxis, loud hailing in communities, and the use of trailer billboards. The Department of Community Safety has recently started a weekly radio show on Radio Zibonele , with shows focusing on COVID-19 safety, isolation and quarantine and other important messages. These are just some of the strategies that are being employed in our hotspots to ensure that we can slow the spread and protect our most vulnerable. This plan is a whole of society plan and we need everyone to do their part to help. The Coronavirus is going to be with us for a long time still and in order to ensure that the province does not experience new spikes in infection, we must all play our part. You can keep yourself and your loved ones safe by staying home as much as possible, and wearing a mask correctly, and keeping a distance of 1.5 metres between yourself and any other person when you do go out. Washing your hands, not touching your face and coughing into your arm or elbow are simple steps that we can all take to protect ourselves and others. Brackengate discharges first patient: Tanduxolo Mkhetshane from Town 3 Khayelitsha became the first patient to leave our brand new Brackengate temporary hospital after being discharged yesterday. He was among the first group of people through the brand new hospital's doors when they opened on Monday, and by Wednesday, had recovered enough to go home. Our temporary field hospitals offer intermediate care, and so many of the patients admitted there will be on their way to recovery. They allow us to ensure that those with COVID-19 who still need medical care are able to receive it, while at the relieving pressure on our acute care facilities so that more serious or complex cases can be treated there. We wish Mr Mkhetshane all the best as he continues his journey to a full recovery at home. We also thank all of the healthcare workers at the hospital for ensuring that Mr Mkhetshane was well taken care of. His stay may have been brief but the role you have played, and will continue to play for many more patients, is an important one. Issued by Western Cape Office of the Premier, 25 July 2020
