It is alleged that Matsena was stabbed to death at his house in Doornpoort, Tshwane by an unknown suspect. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));The incident occurred last night  and the suspect is still at large. The motive for his murder is still unknown. The fact that Matsena was stabbed to death at his place of residence once again indicates that no one is safe in their own homes in South Africa. Matsena was dedicated and committed to fighting crime and ensuring the safety of all Gauteng residents. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));We call on both the Gauteng MEC for Community Safety, Faith Mazibuko, and the Gauteng SAPS Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Elias Mawela, to launch a manhunt for the suspect and to ensure that no stone is left unturned. The DA will continue to monitor the progress with regards to the investigation into this incident to ensure that the law takes its course and that the deceased’s family gets the justice they deserve. The DA sends our deepest condolences to the family, relatives, friends, and the African National Congress on the loss of Matsena. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_5',115,'0','1']));May his soul Rest in Eternal Peace.
