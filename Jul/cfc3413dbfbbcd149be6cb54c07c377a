The murder of Comrade Mapiti has devastated the ANC, Alliance, Mass Democratic Movement and all freedom-loving people of South Africa. The arrest of the alleged perpeptrator sends a clear message to the general public that our law-enforcement agencies will leave no stone unturned to ensure that those responsible for this barbaric crime face the full might of the law. This distinguished son of the soil placed his entire life in service of the ANC and the people of South Africa for many years. Death has robbed us of a committed and dedicated servant of our revolution. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));At the time of his passing, Cde Mapiti was a member of the Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) and Provincial Working Committee (PWC) of the ANC in Gauteng, and also Member of the Gauteng Provincial Legislature and Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Safety and Security. Prior to that, he was Deputy Chairperson of the ANC in the Tshwane region. He also worked at the City of Tshwane as Strategic Executive Head. We commend our members and structures in Gauteng and Tshwane for the support they are giving to the Matsena family and for working with the family to ensure that Cde Mapiti is given a dignified send-off. The ANC conveys its heartfelt condolences to the Matsena family, the ANC in Gauteng and the entire Mass Democratic Movement. May the Matsena family find solace in the knowledge that the entire nation shares their grief. We wish them strength and fortitude during this difficult time.
