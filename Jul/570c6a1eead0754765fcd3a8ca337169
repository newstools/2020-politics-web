This means that in some instances, cases could be allocated to the wrong sub-districts. We are working with the sub-districts to clean and verify the data and where errors are picked up locally, cases will be re-allocated to the correct areas. More data is available here: https://coronavirus.westerncape.gov.za/covid-19-dashboard The Western Cape has recorded an additional 29 deaths, bringing the total number of COVID-19 related deaths in the province to 2616. We send our condolences to their loved ones at this time. An explanation of today's data: The total number of cases in the Western Cape is lower today than it was yesterday. This is because some cases from other provinces were mistakenly allocated to the Western Cape over the past week. This has been corrected, and as such, the total number of cases stands at 83948 today. End of my isolation period: Today marks 14 days since I first started experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. When I first started my isolation, the mandatory self-isolation period was 14 days- however Minister Zweli Mkhize announced on Friday that this has now been revised to 10 days for those who test positive, in line with WHO recommendations. I have therefore completed my isolation. My health is slowly improving, although I am still experiencing some symptoms such as a cough. Over the past two weeks, I have been following my doctor's instructions to rest as much as possible, especially as I am in the high risk group of being a type 2 diabetic. I have therefore been conducting a limited number of essential meetings from home during this period, but I am due to return to work tomorrow. I will continue to take precautions until I am fully recovered. I urge anyone who is COVID-19 positive, and especially those who fall into high risk groups, being over the age of 55 or with underlying illnesses, to do the same. Diabetics should also be monitoring themselves and their blood glucose levels closely. Over this period, I have been overwhelmed by the kindness and care shown to me by people from across the province and the country. I am grateful for all of the messages, and support, which reflect the wonderful spirit of the people of this country. I ask that we all continue to hold those who are sick in our thoughts and take all the necessary precautions to ensure that we protect ourselves and others from contracting COVID-19. Staying home whenever possible, or wearing a mask and social distancing when we do go out, are important steps in ensuring that we can slow the spread of the virus in this country. Hygiene measures such as hand washing, cleaning surfaces and covering your nose and mouth when you cough or sneeze remain important at all times. These are simple precautions that can have a major impact, and I thank those people who have really taken every effort to protect themselves and their loved ones.
