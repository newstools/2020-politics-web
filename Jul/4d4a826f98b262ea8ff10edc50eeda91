Independent investigators tasked with Khayelitsha anti-land invasion case Executive Mayor Alderman Dan Plato has announced that independent investigators will probe the circumstances around an anti-land invasion operation in Khayelitsha. ‘I have asked that the City’s internal investigation be handed over to independent investigators to ensure the findings are above reproach, given the public interest in the matter,’ said Mayor Plato.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0'])); All video and photographic evidence, including footage taken by residents and law enforcement officers, will be handed over to independent investigators, who will further conduct their own interviews. Included in this evidence is footage showing a man to have been initially clothed at the time of the operation, and not taking a shower/bath in his structure as reported. ‘Despite reports that Mr Qholani purposefully undressed in an attempt to prevent the anti-land invasion operation from taking place, I do not condone the undignified and shameful circumstances surrounding this incident. We will await the findings of the independent investigators in this regard. I have asked that this matter be concluded by no later than Friday, 10 July,’ said Mayor Plato.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0'])); The Mayor’s decision follows recommendations by Executive Director for Safety and Security, Richard Bosman, and Mayoral Committee Member for Safety and Security, Alderman JP Smith. In terms of a High Court order, the City of Cape Town is permitted to remove any new illegally erected structures on the land in question. This is besides 49 structures which the court allowed to remain on the land in Empolweni temporarily until the matter is heard in full. Despite the court order, Law Enforcement has been dealing with near daily land invasion attempts at the property, including on the day of the incident in question.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0'])); A major bulk water supply project, with a cost of R162 million, is underway on the illegally invaded land in question. It involves the installation of a 6.3 km pipeline from Faure to Khayelitsha along Baden Powell Drive, and will strengthen water supply to the whole of Khayelitsha.
