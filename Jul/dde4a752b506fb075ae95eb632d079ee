We foresaw the opportunistic and parasitic tendencies of the ruling government because we have come to understand that there is no integrity left in the ruling party, and thieving has continued at the expense of human life. There have been no substantive measures to curb corruption that has manifested itself in inflated tenders for PPE procurement and dodgy disbursement of tenders to relatives, friends and colleagues of the ruling elite. Members of the public have no means of reporting corruption and irregularities relating to COVID-19. and seemingly we are heading towards another defining era of rampant corruption under the leadership of Cyril Ramaphosa. Parliament has in the past been chastised for not doing anything about State Capture, and as the EFF we refuse to be part of an impotent Parliament that is not proactive in fighting what is now a pandemic of corruption. We have therefore written to the Speaker of Parliament, Thandi Modise for an opportunity to table an urgent draft resolution for approval as a resolution of the house, with a debate on COVID-19 Procurement and the Role of Parliament in Combatting corruption in terms of Rule 119. Central to our proposed resolution is the following: a. The establishment of an ad-hoc pariamentary inquiry committee which will summon public officials and representatives to account on COVID-19 Procurement and call on members of the public to report all corruption and wrong-doing. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_4',114,'0','0']));b. The Committee must receive reports from all govemment departments and must have the parliamentary powers to sumrnon all public and private entities involved in COVID-19 procurement, including the Solidarity Fund. c. The ad-hoc Committee shall be chaired by a member of the opposition and must be comprised of the following composition, ANC-6, DA-2, EFF-I, Other Parties-3. We cannot sit idly by while vultures use a human crisis to enrich themselves and further collapse the South African economy. It has abundantly ckar that Cyril Ramaphosa is no different from his predecessor and the â€¢New Dawn' is committed to protecting corrupt behaviour. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_5',115,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_6',115,'0','1']));We must intervene before it is tcn late and future generations are left with a shell for a country to inherit.
