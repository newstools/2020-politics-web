DA calls for political parties to act responsibly in Tshwane Council 27 February 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) calls for political parties to behave responsibly by attending today's Tshwane council sitting and focusing on the business of council and the approval of the adjustment budget and much needed by-laws and other service delivery programmes for the benefit of the city and its residents. The adjustment budget needs to be approved by 28 February, in order for the city to realign the budget to the identified service delivery needs. Failure to approve the budget will have a negative impact on all residents in Tshwane. In short, Councillors from all sides should put the people of Tshwane first. The resolution of differences is best achieved through respect for constitutional and legislative procedures and due process in an environment conducive to civil discourse. Moreover, the outcomes of democratic processes should be respected. The DA, therefore, calls on all political parties to put politics aside and remember why they were elected to office as they enter the council chamber tomorrow. We will continue to reach out to all political parties in the City of Tshwane to find common ground, where we can unite and work towards a better working relationship and continue to deliver quality services to the residents.
