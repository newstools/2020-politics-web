More stringent measures needed to curb train accidents 13 February 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng is calling on the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) to put more stringent measures in place to ensure that train accidents do not occur. Prasa has been experiencing numerous incidents including train accidents, cable theft, vandalism and the burning of trains. In the latest incident, a Premier Classe passenger train collided with a stationary goods train between Roodepoort and Horizon Station in Johannesburg. One passenger was airlifted to Milpark Hospital but later died, while the other four injured passengers were taken to Krugersdorp Hospital. This is one of many incidents which highlights the need for our commuters to be given a safe, reliable and affordable public transport system. Commuters who are solely dependent on the services of Metrorail are always at the short end of the stick because they now have to make alternative transport arrangements. The DA would like to extend its deepest condolences to the family of the deceased and wish those who were injured a speedy recovery. The DA will continue to put pressure on the MEC for Roads and Transport, Jacob Mamabolo to liaise with the National Minister of Transport, Fikile Mbalula to speed up the process of handing over the Prasa services to the province. This process will ensure proper maintenance and security of our trains. Issued byFred Nel,DA Gauteng Shadow MEC for Transport, 13 February 2020
