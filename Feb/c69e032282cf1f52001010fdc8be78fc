Shivambu's counsel, Ross McKernan, submitted that representations were made to the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) on February 4, and he understood three more weeks were required for the outcome. The law allowed someone accused of a crime the opportunity to make representations on why they feel the case against them should not go ahead. eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0']));Shivambu faced a charge of common assault for allegedly assaulting photographer Adrian de Kock at Parliament's precinct on March 20, 2018.
