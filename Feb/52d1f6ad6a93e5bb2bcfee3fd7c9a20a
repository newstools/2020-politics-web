According to the municipal report, the official allegedly siphoned off an amount of R3 918 716.89. According to this report, the official transferred the money to their personal account in December 2019. We welcome the swift action of the police on this serious matter. We believe that those who steal hard-earned public funds must be punished. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','1']));In addition to the more than R3 million stolen by the official, it is alleged that there was also a R89 000 transfer which contributed to the buying of a new car for this official. The said official also allegedly bought herself a laptop that is different from the one used by others in the municipality. It is clear that the official was on a mission to milk the municipality to feed her lifestyle. We call for a full investigation of all those who may have been involved in this criminal act. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_4',114,'0','0']));We welcome this arrest and we hope it is just the start and that more heads will roll for stealing the money that should be helping the impoverished people of AbaQulusi. The DA has been consistently calling for tight financial controls in this municipality. We have been hard at work calling for accountability and action to be taken against those who are hell-bent on taking the little that the people of AbaQulusi have. Sadly, all of this is happening whilst the people of AbaQulusi are facing daily struggles of no delivery by the municipality. Water cut-offs are a constant nightmare for the residents. The town of AbaQulusi is in serious dire straits. Issued byÂ Zwakele Mncwango,DA KZN Leader, 5 February 2020eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_6',115,'0','0']));
