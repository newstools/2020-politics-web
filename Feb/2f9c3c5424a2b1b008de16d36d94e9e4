DA will not attend Joburg Council meeting 7 February 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0']));The Democratic Alliance (DA) notes that Councillor Nonceba Molwele has called for a special Council meeting in the City of Johannesburg today. From the Council notice, it is clear that the intention is to replace the DA chief whip and chair of chairs that were evicted at a previous unlawful meeting. As such the DA Councillors will not be attending today's meeting as we are of the view that it is equally unlawful to elect replacements to replace those that were evicted unlawfully. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','1']));Molwele is an illegitimate Speaker who was elected in an illegal meeting after Gauteng Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC Lebogang Maile illegally instructed the City Manager to convene Council. According to the rules, opposition parties should nominate their candidates for chief whip and chair of chairs until the next scheduled Council meeting on 27 February 2020. The ANC is once again ignoring Council rules by allowing an illegitimate Speaker to convene an illegal meeting in the City of Johannesburg.
