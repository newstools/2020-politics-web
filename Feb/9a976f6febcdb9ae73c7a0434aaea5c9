The ANC's coup d'état on Joburg undermines the integrity of Council 7 February 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0']));Today the ANC in the City of Joburg Council convened an extraordinary council meeting to elect the Chief Whip and Chairperson of Chairpersons (Chair of Chairs). Councillor Nonceba Molwele, who is illegitimately occupying the Speaker’s seat, failed to comply with the Rules of Council by firstly not providing all political parties a fair opportunity to participate in the nomination process, and secondly by calling an unscheduled meeting for elections when the rules clearly state that the elections of a Chief Whip and Chair of Chairs must be convened at the next scheduled meeting o 27 February 2020. The DA Caucus has written to the Speaker’s Office informing the office of the rules and requested them to abide by the correct Council procedures. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','1']));For this reason, several parties, including the DA did not attend today's Council Meeting. Ignoring our objections, Councillor Molwele proceeded to convene council. The DA was alerted to the fact that Council did not form quorum. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));The minimum number of councillors required to form a quorum in the Joburg Council is 136 and we were informed that only 134 councillors were present in today’s Council meeting. Yet, the ANC’s Molwele continued to preside over an illegal meeting which was not quorate. Molwele’s claim that her own officials missed a person in their count is dubious to say the least. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_5',115,'0','0']));Councillor Franco De Lange of the Freedom Front Plus left council after the official count of 135 was announced. Today’s events are demonstrating that the ANCs coup d’état on our Legislature is undermining the integrity of Council and the Rules which underpin how Councillors conduct themselves as representatives of the people. They have deliberately flouted and ignored every core rule and principle that governs how elections are to be conducted in Council. Such actions effectively render the functioning of our council to be null and void, as our Council Rules have been sacrificed for political expediency. This erosion of Council Rules sets a dangerous precedent and presents a crisis for Joburg’s democracy. We will weigh all available options and want to assure the residents of Johannesburg that we will not allow the ANC to disregard the rules. Once again, we call on the ANC to follow the letter of the law. Issued by Funzela Ngobeni, DA CoJ Caucus Leader and DA Regional Chairperson, 7 February 2020
