ANC case against DA collapses again 7 February 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0']));The African National Congress (ANC) has again withdrawn a Court action, this time against the Speaker of Tshwane, Councillor Katlego Mathebe and the Chief Whip of Council, Councillor Christo Van Den Heever. In truth, they were going to be thrown out. The withdrawal comes hours after the ANC served an urgent legal application against the DA. It is the second such withdrawal. Recently, the Gauteng Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC Lebogang Maile withdrew after being advised his case was very weak. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','1']));The DA was confident that the ANC would struggle to prove urgency because the matters they are dealing with are both bad in law and are already the subject of the review application pending in the High Court. Their case also contained allegations that were devoid of fact. The ANC’s understanding of the law is sadly lacking. Maile's allegations of gross misconduct against Mathebe and Van Den Heever were intended to derail the city from continuing the good work of delivering services to the residents of Tshwane. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));The DA is confident that rulings made by the Speaker are lawful and can stand in any court of law. The ANC should rather focus on fixing their own house and allow the DA to focus on the business of Council and approving much-needed by-laws and other service delivery programmes to the benefit of the city and its residents.
