Eskom offers voluntary separation packages to senior management; there will be no forced retrenchments 13 January 2020 Eskom has commenced offering voluntary separation packages (VSP) targeted at senior employees. The VSP process will be implemented during March and April 2020. There will be no forced retrenchments. The VSP excludes workers at the lower levels (non-managerial). Eskom will ensure that no critical skills will be lost as a result of the programme, and management will take every precaution to ensure that the VSP process caters to the best interests of Eskom. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0']));Through this process, Eskom will spend R400 million in order to cut overhead costs. This will be recouped through savings within a year. The purpose of the separation process is to rationalise management layers, which will lead to an efficiently run company.
