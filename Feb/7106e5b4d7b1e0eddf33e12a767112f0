Coronavirus: FF Plus requests that all hospitals in Limpopo are put on high alert 5 February 2020 Even though the official of the Groblers Bridge border post on the border between Limpopo and Botswana tested negative for the coronavirus, the FF Plus will keep monitoring the situation. The FF Plus yesterday sent a letter to the MEC for Health in Limpopo, Dr Phophi Ramathuba, requesting that all hospitals in the province must be put on high alert in case there is an outbreak of the virus. Implementing the necessary precautions at hospitals to prepare for a possible outbreak of the virus cannot be put off any longer. In the context of the five possible cases of coronavirus infection that were reported in Botswana, an awareness campaign must be launched at once to inform people of the signs and symptoms associated with the virus. The FF Plus is calling on people to take the necessary precautionary measures and to go for medical treatment immediately if they show any symptoms that may be linked to the virus. This applies to people who recently visited the affected countries or who have had contact with people who have travelled there.
