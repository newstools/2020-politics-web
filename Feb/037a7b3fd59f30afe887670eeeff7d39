EFF statement on appointment of Cyril Ramaphosa as Chair of the African Union 10 February 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0']));The EFF notes the appointment of Cyril Ramaphosa as the Chair of the African Union (AU). We note the appointment of Ramaphosa as a missed opportunity to appoint a progressive African leader who would lead the continent towards independent economic development and progressive legislation towards African unity. The key objectives of the AU are outlined as the achievement of greater unity between African countries, the defence of the independence of its Member States, the promotion of integrated African economies, good governance and sustainable economic development in Africa. Cyril Ramaphosa is incapable and indecisive to be trusted with such an important mandate. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','1']));Under the leadership of Cyril Ramaphosa, there has been a lack of accountability, transparency and good governance. This is evident in his sealing the "CR17" documents which may reveal the sophisticated capture of himself, the judiciary, media and the many NGOs funded by white-monopoly capital. The collective led by Ramaphosa is currently presiding over looting of State-Owned Entities in South Africa, leaving the state incapable leading any strategic development and industrialization. Cyril Ramaphosa currently leads a nation with high levels of unemployment, where 50% of the youth is unemployed. He leads a nation currently undergoing mass retrenchments and low-levels of economic growth. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));During the massive looting South Africa experienced in the years of Gupta Capture Ramaphosa failed to defend our nation from thieves as the Deputy President. Most recently, it is the ANC of Ramaphosa which signed into law a reactionary Refugee Amendment Act that strips refugees and asylum seekers of their rights to political activity in South Africa. It is a law that prohibits them from seeking international solidarity in South Africa to remove despotic and corrupt regimes. The EFF finds it hypocritical that in his acceptance speech as the Chair of the AU; Cyril Ramaphosa calls for the silence of guns in the continent, while he played such a critical role in their noise in Marikana. The noise of guns in the continent is a direct result of the interests of imperialism, which Ramaphosa has proven to be a loyal servant of as seen in Marikana. The instability and conflict in Libya that Ramaphosa laments on is a direct result of the political interference of the United States. It was the government of the ANC that assisted imperialist forces in the removal and assassination of Muammar Gaddafi, leading to the complete collapse of Libya and the region. The appointment of Cyril Ramaphosa is therefore an elevation of a man who has failed to lead South Africa domestically onto the continental stage. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','0']));Africa needs leadership that understands the importance of both political and economic freedom, the need to collapse colonial borders which undermine the AU's agenda towards African unity and economic emancipation of the African continent to usher socialism. As a man beholden to capital, he will further plunge the continent into corruption, underdevelopment and dependency on imperialist forces.
