One little boy sat on the pavement with a cloth over his forehead, as another child cried "Oh my God" over and over in shock. The front of the taxi was mangled, and the side of the MyCiTi bus was severely damaged and missing some of its windows.

Concerns are being raised about the safety of children on their way to, and at, school after a series of tragedies since the beginning of the new academic year. On Saturday, Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi said this year's death toll of pupils in the province had risen to 18, after a Grade 4 pupil from Diepsloot was struck by lightning and died on Friday afternoon while walking home with school mates. In January, the driver of a minibus taxi pulled over by Bela-Bela metro officers was charged with overloading when 58 schoolchildren were found crammed into his vehicle. That vehicle was not registered with the department for any category of official public transportation in the province. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-banner-1','ezslot_4',116,'0','0']));The Road Traffic Management Corporation's State of Road Safety Report: Calendar for 2018 found that minibuses accounted for 9% of crashes, and most collisions happened on Saturdays (25%) and Sundays (22%). The cause of Tuesday's crash will be investigated. News24
