SACP condemns neo-colonial agenda by Mike Pompeo, representative of the Donald Trump imperialist regime 20 February 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));The South African Communist Party (SACP) strongly condemns Mike Pompeo, United States (US) secretary of state, for his neo-colonial utterances opposed to the redress of the injustices committed under colonial and apartheid oppression in South Africa. Pompeo used the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa on Wednesday 19 February in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to attack South African government-led efforts to achieve equitable land redistribution and end landlessness. Tens of millions of the oppressed people of South Africa were bloodily expropriated, and for that matter without compensation, under colonisation and successive colonial and apartheid dictatorial regimes. Restitution and equitable redistribution of land to end inequality, homelessness, hunger and pioneer human development are key principles of redress – a democratic measure provided for in our country’s constitution. Pompeo proved to have come to Africa to enforce US imperialism – extraterritorial influence and rule of the US dog eat dog capitalist regime – in opposition to democratic post-colonial transformation towards social justice and shared prosperity. South Africa is not a colony of the US or dominion of any type. It is an independent democratic republic. The SACP rejects foreign interference with contempt. Our democratic national sovereignty is sacrosanct. We will defend it, as we fought against colonialism and apartheid.
