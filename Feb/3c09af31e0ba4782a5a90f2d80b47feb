DA commends Tshwane on its 'Follow the Money' programme 4 February 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) commends the DA-led City of Tshwane for increasing its service delivery efforts to ensure that residents' money is being spent as it should be. The city’s “Follow the Money” programme is aimed at ensuring that all 284 projects that were promised to residents in line with the Integrated Development Plan (IDP) during the 2019/20 financial year and multi-year projects are being implemented. The DA is pleased to note that among other projects visited today, the Centurion Taxi Rank, which will cater for 15 000 commuters daily, is 95% completed; 2832 homes will be electrified during phases one and two of the Pienaarspoort Electrification Project; the formalization of the Phomolong Informal Settlement is almost 60% completed and 1063 stands will be electrified and the overall progress of the construction of water reticulation to service 390 stands in NellmapiusExtention 22 is 70% completed. While we recognise that there is still much to be done, the DA is working hard to ensure that residents' money is spent correctly, and that progress is being made to improve the lives of the people of Tshwane.
