Coronavirus: DA requests urgent Executive Statement from Minister Pandor on the fate of 85 stranded South Africans in China 18 February 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));The Democratic Alliance (DA) has been in contact with officials from the Department of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO) to inform them of around 85 South Africans who are currently stuck in China, despite them wanting to be evacuated and returned to South Africa in light of the outbreak of the Coronavirus. Whilst the DA was heartened to learn that South African students and teachers had been evacuated from China it was disappointing to hear that these 85 South African citizens were being completely ignored by the South African government. The DA has therefore written to Minister Naledi Pandor to request that she makes an urgent Executive Statement to the National Assembly as to why only half the South African community in China were assisted out of the country and the other half has been left to their own devices. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));Rule 133 of the National Assembly makes provision for a Minister to request the Speaker for an opportunity to make a statement on pertinent matters which Parliament should be informed of. The DA is of the view that the outbreak of Coronavirus and its impact on the wellbeing of South African citizens warrants such a statement.  The DA has been fielding frantic calls from concerned parents and family and often has to offer the support that the government should be offering. When something major like an evacuation takes place, it is vital that the reasons why that evacuation was allowed and the other was not is conveyed so that it alleys any fears that politics was at play. The South African Embassy in China’s response to the outbreak has been far from perfect with allegations of aggression, lack of communication and now a further closure until further notice without any South African contact number being conveyed. The DA implores upon officials to be more supportive of those South Africans who are still left behind. Furthermore, the DA calls on DIRCO and the Department of Health to implement proper procedures for those entering South Africa from China such as placing people returning to the country under quarantine for 14 days at the Waterkloof Airforce Base, as temperature control is simply not an accurate enough reflection of the presence of the virus. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2',114,'0','0']));Whilst South Africa has not had any confirmed cases of the Coronavirus, the threat is very much present and government should do all in its power to prevent any South African from contracting this deadly virus. As always the DA sends its sympathy and support through the Embassy of China in South Africa to China and its people for a speedy recovery.
