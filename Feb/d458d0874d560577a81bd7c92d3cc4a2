Gauteng losing status as economic powerhouse 11 February 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0']));Gauteng under the ANC is slowly losing its status as one of Africa’s biggest economic powerhouses, as unemployment figures soar. Gauteng, currently has the fourth highest unemployment rate of all the provinces, with 30.8% of the population sitting without a job, and poor people are finding it increasingly harder to put food on the table. Statistics SA’s Quarterly Labour Force Survey (QLFS) revealed today that the number of jobless people in South Africa reached 6,7 million in quarter 4 in 2019 compared with 4,4 million in the same period in 2009. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));The report provides a truer reflection of the real unemployment situation in Gauteng and in South Africa as a whole. It is clear that the ANC government has failed to create enough jobs to keep up with the growing number of jobseekers in the province.
