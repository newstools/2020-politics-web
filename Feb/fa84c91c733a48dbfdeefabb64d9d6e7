Statement of the ANC on the by-elections results 27 February 2020 The African National Congress (ANC) is encouraged by the results of the by-elections held yesterday. The ANC retained two wards (in Mhlontlo Municipality, Eastern Cape and Thulamela Municipality, Limpopo) and won one ward from the Democratic Alliance in Matzikama in the Western Cape. The results communicate a clear and unambiguous message that the ANC remains the only hope for the people of South Africa. In particular, the by-elections results in the Western Cape demonstrate that the people of the Western Cape have confidence that ANC has both the capacity and political commitment to change their lives for the better. The results also confirm the disintegration of the DA and the irreversible ascendancy of the ANC in the Western Cape. We call on all our members and structures to sustain this positive momentum. We are humbled by the unwavering confidence that the people of South Africa across the country continue to have in the ANC. Voters continue to see the ANC as the only trusted vehicle that will transform their lives. As the ANC, we do not take this confidence for granted. We are determined to redouble our efforts in our quest to expand access to a better life for all. The ANC would like to thank its structures, members, supporters, volunteers and everyone who contributed to these decisive victories. These outcomes are a positive building block towards overwhelming victory in the upcoming local government elections in 2021. We call on all councillors of the ANC to put the plight of their communities first and to serve with humility and selflessness. Issued by Pule Mabe, National Spokesperson, ANC, 27 February 2020
