DA opens policy input to the public 9 February 2020 On Friday the Democratic Alliance (DA) published an online portal where members of the public, party members and public representatives can give feedback on the DA's important new draft policies. This will be the first time that any political party in South Africa has taken the unprecedented step to ask for input by the public on policies. The first document open for submissions is the party's draft Values and Principles document that was released last week. This document is the point of departure for the rest of the DA's policy positions that will be released ahead of the DA's Policy Conference that will take place on 4 and 5 April in Johannesburg. The draft Values and Principles document as well as the draft Economic Justice policy and draft Local Government priorities will all be discussed, potentially amended and adopted by delegates at the conference. The DA intends our Values and Principles document to be a social contract that we would like to co-sign with the people of South Africa. That is why it is important for us that South Africans engage us on this document.
