Why MKMVA has not issued a statement at national level about issuing of warrant of arrest against President Zuma 6 February 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0']));We have now been asked many times for the reason why MKMVA National has not issued a statement about the issuing of a warrant of arrest against #PresidentZuma, which we are very angered and distraught about. MKMVA is currently engaged in negotiations as instructed by the ANC NEC, together with the so-called MK National Council under the NEC Peace & Stability Sub-Committee. It was agreed that for the duration of these negations neither MKMVA national nor the MK National Council will issue statements. However, the MKMVA provinces and regions are free to issue statements, and the sentiments expressed in this statement by our MKMVA Sedibeng Region and Limpopo Province, are strongly felt and supported throughout MKMVA. *** Statement on the issuing of warrant of arrest against former president Zuma eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0'])); The MKMVA Sedibeng Region is shocked and perplexed by the issuing of an arrest warrant by judge Pillay in KZN at the request of the NPA under lead prosecutor Billy Downer. We believe the judge erred and capitulated to pressure by the NPA and this a gross violation of the work of our judiciary. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));But what is even more worrying is the role the NPA is prepared to play in the body politics of South Africa. The call for former president Zuma to be arrested despite his decade of court appearance and him subjection himself to the rule of law is clearly an abuse of the court's process. Mr Billy Downer has clearly made this trail political. We call on the NDPP MsShamilahBatohi to take a stand on this matter and not allow the NPA to userd and abused for narrow party political objectives as we witnessed a decade ago under its former NDPP. As the MKMVA we will defend ANC leadership from abuse by the those in the state who are prepared to leverage the state apparatus to divide the ANC. eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','0']));*** Statement of MKMVA in Limpopo province on arrest warrant of President Jacob Zuma We as a PEC of mkmva in Limpopo we are taken aback by this kind of treatment towards the former President of this who has sacrificed so immensely for the people of this country and the judiciary to abuse it's independency over him as an individual. I must say we are also not surprised about that kind of a decision as it is showing us some glimpses of what is to transpire in the end of this trial. As members of mkmva we are very much worried about some people who gets some preferential treatment in our judiciary system and nothing happens but here is a former President who has never abused his position to defy the laws of this country is very sick and that a judge who is not even a medico discard a sick leave of a man who has been sick for quite sometime now but he must go to jail. Firstly we are asking ourselves what delayed this case because here a person who suffered under the brutal white minority system and he fought against it so gallantly and deafeted it now they want want to catch up with him under this democratic dispensation and we say this must never happen under our nose as combatants while de klerk is roaming this country giving lectures when he killed the people of Boipatong when he was a commander in chief of sadf. Commanders this is our commander who must be defended at all cost to get a fair trial just like any citizen of this country Issued by Carl Niehaus, 6 February 2020eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-banner-1','ezslot_5',116,'0','0']));
