Msunduzi public transport plan crushed to pay for SAA bailout 27 February 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Msunduzi is angered and outraged by the announcement by the ANC government that our City’s Integrated Public Transport System will be suspended to balance the national budget and bail out SAA. We cannot accept that our City, its growth and development, its economic potential and job creation, can be decimated by the ANC government in the name of continuing to bail out a failing airline, that has become a bottomless pit for public money. Our City desperately needs improved public transport. People remain unable to get reliable transportation to work and to live, yet today we learn with a shock that the promise of an improved transport system has been stolen away by the ANC government. Until such time as the national government stops the waste, corruption and bloated public sector, and stops bailing out failing state-owned entities year after year, the needs of people on the ground will remain trampled on. Our City needs integrated transport, not another SAA bailout. Issued by Sibongiseni Majola,DA Msunduzi Caucus Leader, 27 February 2020
