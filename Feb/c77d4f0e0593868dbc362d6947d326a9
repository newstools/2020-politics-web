Tshwane continues to deliver services, despite ANC antics 6 February 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0']));The Democratic Alliance (DA) commends the DA-led City of Tshwane’s service delivery efforts of ensuring that all 284 projects in the 2019/20 Integrated Development Plan (IDP) and multi-year projects are implemented. Of those projects in progress to date, the installation of the water and sewer reticulation and construction of bulk water and sewage facilities in Hammanskraal Extension 10 giving residents access to basic services and the construction of the new Klipgat Hospital Reservoir will be completed in August this year and will provide adequate water supply capacity to 4700 households in Klipgat and surrounding areas. Furthermore a transactional adviser has been appointed for a 24-month period to build in-house capacity at the Wonderboom Airport. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));The DA is confident that the City is spending residents’ money appropriately. False allegations by the ANC about the city being in turmoil are misrepresenting the true state of the city. As the 2021 local government elections draw nearer, the ANC is becoming increasingly desperate to paint a bleak picture of Tshwane, as a city in disorder. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));While the DA is hard at work to ensure the uninterrupted delivery of services to the residents of Tshwane, it is apparent, that the ANC will stop at nothing to cause continual disruption to block all efforts in this regard. But the DA is aware of the ANC’s tactics and is determined to prevent it from allowing its antics to threaten service delivery to the residents of Tshwane.
