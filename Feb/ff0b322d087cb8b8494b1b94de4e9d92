Yet another female farmer the victim of a farm attack in the Free State 24 February 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));Ms Mimie Jacobs, who was named the Free State Female Farmer of the Year in 2016, was attacked and injured on her farm on Saturday night (22 February 2020). It is extremely worrying that the farmers who receive recognition from the government for their contribution to the agricultural sector, cannot rely on the government to ensure their safety and security. Ms Jacobs is yet another victim of the government's empty promises and apathetic attitude towards gender violence and rural safety. The government must realise that this was not just an attack on a farmer, but an attack on a woman who became the victim of a farm attack as a result of inadequate policing. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_3',113,'0','1']));There are areas in the Free State where there is a lack of cooperation with the police and where there is also a lack of vital resources needed to ensure rural safety. The FF Plus commends the police for their speedy response as well as the members of the community and other role players for their actions after the attack, but still condemns the incident seeing as these efforts are merely reactive. If the police had acted on the FF Plus's pleas for specialist units, farm attacks such as this one and many more could have been averted due to visible policing in unsafe rural areas. The police should have more than a reactive policing plan. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_4',114,'0','0']));A government that does not take action means nothing. Rural communities deserve effective action plans with tangible solutions that are visibly implemented on grass-roots level. The FF Plus expresses its deepest condolences to the victim and her friends and family and wishes her a speedy recovery. The FF Plus will keep fighting for the safety of our farmers.
