ANC Calls for more Illegal Elections in the City of Joburg Council 5 February 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_3',112,'0','0']));The Democratic Alliance (DA) Caucus notes with concern that the Office of Speaker has called for an illegal election on Friday, 7 February 2020. Friday’s meeting was purely called to elect a new Council Chief Whip, Chairperson of Chairpersons (Chair of Chairs) and fill several Chairperson vacancies.  This follows the motions of no confidence that were tabled last week Wednesday. By calling this Meeting which concerns the election of Council Office Bearers, the ANC is once again flagrantly ignoring the Council Rules. In the same way the ANC disregarded the procedures governing the election of a Speaker, they are once again flouting council rules that guide how elections must be conducted. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','1']));In failing to adhere to the rules of these elections the so-called Speaker’s decision to hold this meeting is irrational.  According to the Rules the Speaker is supposed to allow Political Parties the opportunity to nominate their candidates until at least the 27th of February 2020 which is when the next scheduled Council Meeting will take place.  She is therefore robbing political parties of 20 days in which time they would have been able to consult with their Caucuses and decide on the appropriate candidate.  It is unclear what Cllr Molwele’s motives are for trying to fast-track these elections. As we have consistently maintained, Councillor Molwele is an illegitimate Speaker and therefore has no authority on which to convene Council.  The Council Meeting in which she was elected was convened in contravention of our Council Rules, after MEC Maile illegally instructed the City Manager to convene Council. It is quite clear with the latest actions that the ANC will not stop until it has broken every single Council Rule in their quest to seize power at all costs. This latest stunt is a direct insult to the residents of Joburg who expect Councillors to uphold the rule of law and lead by example. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_4',114,'0','0']));We will oppose Cllr Molwele’s actions and will continue to use all available avenues to ensure that the ANC are held accountable for their disdainful conduct.  We urge the ANC to abide by the law and comply with Council Rules.
