The RPO has worked very hard with the department and industry to reach this point,” says Mr Koos van der Ryst, Chairman of the RPO. It was an extremely drastic measure which had a very negative impact on producers and the industry. However, it also bore fruit in the sense that South Africa was successful in opening its most important export markets in spite of the loss of its foot and mouth disease (FMD) free zone status. The opening of Chinese trade is a very relevant example of this. The RPO also welcomes the fact that auction agents are now obligated to register with the Agriculture Products Agents’ Council (APAC). The Agricultural Products Agents' Council was established in 1992 in terms of Act 12 of 1992 and the enforcement of the Act is crucial. The RPO encourages all agents to do this. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));“Self-regulation has now become of critical importance in the red meat industry if we want to protect our markets and every producer in the country must assist us with this”, Koos van der Ryst said. It includes the establishment of a voluntary traceability system which the industry will implement in conjunction with LITS-SA. Article 6 and Article 8 of the Stock Theft Act can immediately be applicable to auctions, as well as animal health declarations. The industry has already established measures in conjunction with the RPO which should be applicable when auctions are conducted in the future. These measures will be announced soon and will be implemented by the Registrar of Agricultural Products Agents over time. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2',114,'0','0']));It is also imperative that control measures for FMD be sharpened in those three provinces acting as buffer zones for the control of FMD. The affected facilities where outbreaks occurred must now be effectively managed in order for the problem to be resolved. “We all learned some lessons from the recent events”, Koos van der Ryst said. “Producers will in future have to take more responsibility for the prevention of controlled and notifiable diseases on their farms. The RPO’s Code of Best Practice provides specific guidelines in this respect.” Issued by Gerhard Schutte, Chief Executive Officer, RPO, 18 February 2020eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','0']));
