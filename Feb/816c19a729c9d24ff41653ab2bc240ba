SAPS not doing enough to curb cash-in-transit heists 20 February 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng is deeply concerned about the recent spike in the number of cash-in-transit heists in the province. According to the South Africa Banking Risk Information Centre (Sabric), there are 35 cases of cash-in-transit heists that have been reported countrywide since February last year. Gauteng has recorded the highest number of cash-in-transit heists nationally with 21 reported incidents. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_3',113,'0','1']));This is worrying and clearly indicates that Gauteng is facing a serious challenge of crime and our people are not safe. For far too long, the DA has been calling on the SAPS to put more stringent measures in place to tackle heist gangs. The latest figures highlight that the SAPS approach to the cash-in-transit heists is not effective. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_4',114,'0','0']));The Specialised Intelligence Unit must be adequately trained and equipped with the latest technology to deal with this scourge. This unit should establish networks all over the country that gathers information ahead of any heist attempts as well as the latest modi operandi of the heist gangs. We call on the Gauteng Premier, David Makhura to engage with both the Gauteng SAPS Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Elias Mawela and their national counterpart, Minister of Police to find a holistic approach in clamping down on the plague of cash-in-transit heists in the province.
