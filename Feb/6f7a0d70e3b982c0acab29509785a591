ANC makes further feeble attempts to remove Tshwane Speaker 4 February 2020  The Democratic Alliance (DA) notes the urgent legal application served on it by the African National Congress (ANC) this afternoon with regards to the alleged misconduct by City of Tshwane Speaker, Councillor Katlego Mathebe and Chief Whip of Council, Councillor Christo Van Den Heever. This is a feeble attempt by the ANC to try and win back some of the losses inflicted on them in recent court judgements. We have consulted our legal counsel and will oppose the application as we have full confidence that the only conduct that should be questioned, is that of the ANC and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) who continue to disrupt meetings and delay service delivery. We believe that after the recent events, the ANC should rather focus on fixing their own house and allow the DA to focus on the business of council and approving much needed by-laws and other service delivery programmes to the benefit of the city and its residents. The ANC will struggle to prove urgency because the matters they are dealing with are both bad in law and are already the subject of the review application pending in the High Court.
