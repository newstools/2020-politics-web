Closure of Mastersâ€™ Offices further proof of moral decline in South Africa 4 February 2020 The search and seizure operations executed at all the Offices of the Master of the High Court today offer further proof of the moral decline in South Africa. Maladministration and corruption must be eradicated on all levels in South Africa. The Department of Justice is supposed to set a good example and even more so the Offices of the Master of the High Court, which administrates the estates of numerous vulnerable individuals. Totally shutting down all the Offices of the Master could have serious legal repercussions. The FF Plus welcomes the investigation, but doubts that it is necessary to bring the activities of this critically important Office to a complete standstill. The Minister of Justice, Mr Ronald Lamola, should have launched an investigation much earlier to prevent the alleged corruption from reaching this level.
