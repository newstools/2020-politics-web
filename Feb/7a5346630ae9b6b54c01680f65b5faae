City planners could learn from China 3 February 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0']));The Western world is rightly astonished by the Chinese Government’s ability to build a 1000-bed hospital in less than two weeks as part of its plan to contain the new corona virus, says Jacques Moolman, Deputy President of the Cape Chamber of Commerce and Industry. “Capetonians in particular are awestruck at the speed with which the Chinese can get a major project completed. “Compared to the sclerotic and Byzantine complexity of getting building plans approved in Cape Town, the Chinese system seems miraculous. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','1']));“The Chamber often receives complaints of long and costly delays in getting building and planning approval for projects in Cape Town. In at least one case the delays were such that a project worth billions was abandoned,” Moolman said. ‘To be fair, In China the hospital was probably built from a standard set of approved plans and prefabricated buildings, so that would have saved a lot of time. Also bureaucratic approvals would have been granted immediately and there would be no public comment delays. “But there can be no doubt that what we need is a re-examination of all the bureaucratic procedures in getting approvals in our city. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));“Really efficient approval processes would make Cape Town much more attractive to developers and would bring in much needed investment and jobs. “We don’t need to adopt the Chinese system but we do need efficient processes to encourage investment. China has shown what is possible and the huge scope for improvement in our local processes,” Moolman concluded.
