Law Society shocked and dismayed at reports of alleged corruption and fraud at Offices of the Master 4 February 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[468,60],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0']));The Law Society of South Africa (LSSA) expresses its shock and dismay on behalf of the profession at the allegations of corruption, fraud and maladministration at the Offices of the Master of the High Court. LSSA President, Mvuzo Notyesi said: ‘We welcome the search and seizure operation for purposes of investigation by the Special Investigation Unit (SIU). Any member who may be implicated in collusion with any theft will face disciplinary action of the strongest nature.’ This theft against the most venerable of our society, is perpetrated against all the people of the country and compromises the institutions that provide oversight and justice of the important assets of the country. The LSSA is committed to assist the investigation as the closure has a negative impact on the clients of attorneys and the profession is steadfast to ensure that the responsible persons are held accountable. The LSSA calls on the Justice Minister to review the structure, processes and operations of the Office of the Master to ensure efficiency, accountability and governance. The Master's Office is there to serve the public in respect of deceased estates, liquidations (insolvent estates), registration of trusts, tutors and curators, as well as the administration of the Guardian's Fund (minors and mentally challenged persons). eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));The Master has wide interaction with members of the public and practitioners and the dealings of the Master has an impact on the economy. The Master's Office has five main divisions and they all strive to protect the financial interests of persons whose assets or interests are, for various reasons, being managed by others. We urge the Deputy Masters in each of the offices, who are the only staff allowed in the offices while the investigation is taking place, to comply completely with the SIU investigation. The public should note that the Master’s Offices countrywide will be shut down during the investigation and will reopen on 5 February.
