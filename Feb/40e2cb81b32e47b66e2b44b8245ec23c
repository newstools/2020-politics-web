Equal Education media statement: EE members  picket at Western Cape SOPA to put key questions to Premier Winde about the Western Cape Safety Plan 20 February 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));Today, Thursday 20 February, Equal Education (EE) Western Cape members are picketing at the Rocklands Civic Centre in Mitchells Plain where Western Cape Premier Alan Winde will be delivering the State of the Province Address (SOPA). EE facilitators, organisers and parent members are gathering to ask Premier Winde critical questions related to the Western Cape Safety Plan and how it will play a role in ensuring #SafeSchools and communities. EE has been campaigning around safety in the Western Cape since 2014.  In an effort to understand the nature and complexity of school violence, EE members undertook a social audit of 244 schools in 2015. The scope of the audit was able to provide a clear sense of systemic safety challenges, which included both psychosocial and infrastructural challenges within Western Cape schools. This is an important consideration as provincial leaders develop a safety plan. On 25 October 2019, hundreds of learners marched to the Western Cape Provincial Legislature  to express their frustrations regarding the safety challenges faced in schools, and the lack of responsiveness and accountability from the provincial government. Equalisers called on the Western Cape Education Department (WCED) and South African police Services (SAPs) to provide the support, resources and capacity necessary to ensure #SafeSchools and safe communities for all. This requires compliance with the Norms and Standards for Public School Infrastructure deadline and interdepartmental efforts geared towards improving school safety. Premier Winde and Education MEC Debbie Schäfer were both invited to the march, however, they failed to be present to receive our memorandum and engage learners - instead they did what they always do and sent representatives. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_3',113,'0','1']));On 3 October 2019, EE members attended a community engagement in Delft where the Premier presented the Western Cape Safety Plan. At present, EE members are of the opinion that the safety plan presents us with more questions than answers. Taking into consideration the Westerrn Cape Safety Plan,  we want Premier Winde to address the following questions: What is the purpose of  having the SOPA in Mitchell’s Plain  if it is not going to be accessible to its people? Why is it taking place when the affected people are at school and work? eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_4',114,'0','0']));What means have you implemented  to ensure communities are aware of this safety plan?

What  measures have been put in place, in the safety plan, to ensure the  psycho-social needs of learners are seen to? eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_5',115,'0','0']));Is the deployment of 3 000 law enforcement officers a sustainable solution? How do communities hold these law enforcement officersaccountable? What is the allocation process of law enforcement? Whether law enforcement deployment works is not the main question.  Instead, we need to ask whether it is a sustainable solution to safety challenges faced within the province. How long will this be carried out? What are the possible long term interventions? Questions related toeducation What measures are currentlyin place to hold Western Cape Education MEC Debbie Schäfer accountable? Education receives a substantial chunk of the provincial budget. Where is this  budget breakdown for school safety specifically? Issued by Jay-Dee Cyster, Communications Officer, Equal Education, 20 February 2020
