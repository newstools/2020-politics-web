ANC statement on FW de Klerk’s unconditional apology 18 February 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));The African National Congress (ANC) has noted the unconditional apology by the FW de Klerk Foundation conveyed on behalf of Mr FW de Klerk over his offensive utterances about apartheid. The ANC has consistently maintained, in line with the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid, that apartheid was and remains a crime against humanity. The Convention adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1973 declared that apartheid is a crime against humanity, and that inhuman acts resulting from the policies and practices of apartheid and similar policies and practices of racial segregation and discrimination are crimes violating the principles of international law, in particular the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and constituting a serious threat to international peace and security. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));The sincerity of Mr de Klerk's apology will be tested by his posture to selflessly commit both in words and in deeds towards the advancement of the ongoing reconstruction and development project through nation building in his local community. All peace-loving South Africans are expected at all times to acknowledge that coming from our deeply divided past and having invested so much in healing the wounds of our ugly past, any unfortunate and inconsiderate utterances going against the united spirit of our people is unhealthy for our young democracy. It is therefore expected of our Elders and Statesmen to carry the moral duty of helping to unite and reconcile all of South Africa's people with an unequivocal measure of humility. The callous brutality, oppression, indignity and destruction that apartheid brought to millions of black South Africans should never be trivialized by anyone in our country regardless of their political affiliation, beliefs, skin colour and station in life. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2',114,'0','0']));Any form of denial on the existence of apartheid as a crime against humanity is an affront to the lived reality of the majority of South Africans and a complete digression from the noble cause of social cohesion. Our new democratic society is based on the values of non-racialism, national unity, and acknowledgement of the brutality and injustices of our past. The ANC calls on all South Africans to commit and submit to a social compact that is premised on the permeable of the supreme law of the land: "We, the people of South Africa, Recognise the injustices of our past; Honor those who suffered for justice and freedom in our land; Respect those who have worked to build and develop our country; and Believe that South Africa belongs to all who live in it, united in our diversity" Issued by Pule Mabe, National Spokesperson, ANC, 18 February 2020eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','0']));
