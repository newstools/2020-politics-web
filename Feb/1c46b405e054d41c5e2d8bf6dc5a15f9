"Former President Zuma has never and will never evade the law hence the issuing of the warrant of arrest, stayed or not, was really not necessary, but it was just done to spite the nature and character of the former president. "It was a decision taken out of hatred for the man, it's being vindictive, vicious and very much abuse of the judiciary for personal reasons (sic). This they do forgetting that the old wounds have not healed and we are gradually getting tired of them abusing the system. Our patience is running out as we can see what is happening. However, we don't want to be tested as people," Edward said.

He also questioned the proximity of Judge Pillay to people whom he believed are "hellbent in seeing the destruction of Zuma at all costs". "The hatred they have for Zuma has become their religion and they are busy recruiting, or let me rather say, they are continuing to tell lies and diminish and destroy the legacy of the father of Radical Economic Transformation (RET), free education and land expropriation without compensation."RET will be our mission until the highest structure of my movement decides otherwise. So for now, I will call upon all those that can see what is being done to Zuma to stand up and make ourselves loud in his defence and the defence of RET." News24
