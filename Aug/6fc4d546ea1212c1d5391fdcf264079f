This means that in some instances, cases could be allocated to the wrong sub-districts. We are working with the sub-districts to clean and verify the data and where errors are picked up locally, cases will be re-allocated to the correct areas. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_4',114,'0','0']));More data is available here: https://coronavirus.westerncape.gov.za/covid-19-dashboard The Western Cape has recorded an additional 48 deaths, bringing the total number of COVID-19 related deaths in the province to 3265.  We send our condolences to the loved ones of all the deceased at this time. Mitchells Plain Hospital COVID-19 ward handover: eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_1',115,'0','0']));I would like to express my appreciation to the Gift of the Givers, who have donated R 10 million towards renovating and equipping an entire ward of the Mitchells Plain hospital which will be used to treat COVID-19 patients. The ward, now named the Freesia Ward, was handed over to the Department of Health today. This donation will allow the hospital to open up additional bed capacity for non-COVID-19 services, and use the 60 bed Freesia ward for COVID-19 services. This generous donation will therefore allow us to provide appropriate care to the community of Mitchells Plain in line with our commitment to start re-opening more of our non-COVID related healthcare services over the next few months. We thank the Gift of the Givers and the many organisations who have partnered with us throughout this pandemic. These relationships have helped to ensure that the Western Cape has been able to provide treatment and care for the sick, and will help to ensure that we are able to roll out the full basket of healthcare services in the coming weeks and months. George healthcare workers: I would also like to pay special tribute to the healthcare workers at George hospital. This team of dedicated healthcare workers were able to care for and discharge 12 patients from their COVID-19 ward in one week at the end of last month. This despite the hospital facing increased service pressure, especially in its critical care services. On behalf of all of these patients and their loved ones, I would like to thank all of the staff at the hospital. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-banner-1','ezslot_5',116,'0','0']));The Garden Route has been seeing an increase in new infections and hospitalisations as the region continues to see an upward trajectory on its infection curve. I appeal to all residents of the Garden Route to take precautions to ensure that we are able to flatten the curve, ensure that our hospitals and healthcare workers are not overwhelmed, and ultimately save lives. You can play your part by staying at home as much as possible, washing your hands frequently, wearing your mask when you go outside, avoiding gatherings and practicing social distancing. I also call on all businesses to ensure that they are operating safely, that their staff are wearing masks and social distancing, and to ensure regular cleaning of high traffic surfaces such as counters, credit card machines, lift buttons, door handles, telephones, computers and public restrooms. Minister of Transport and Public Works, Bonginkosi Madikizela will be in the Garden Route from tomorrow, where he will be assessing COVID-19 compliance on public transport and conducting roadblocks.
