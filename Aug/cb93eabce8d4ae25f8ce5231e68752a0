HIV tests drop by 207 000 in Gauteng due to lockdown  13 August 2020 Tests for HIV/Aids in Gauteng from March to May this year dropped by 207 092 compared to the same period last year due to the effects of the Covid-19 lockdown. This is revealed by Acting Health MEC Jacob Mamabolo in a written reply to my questions in the Gauteng Legislature. According to Mamabolo, a total of 909 830 HIV tests were done from March-May 2020, compared to 1 116 922 HIV tests done for the same period last year, which is nearly a 20% drop. Mamabolo attributes the decrease to the introduction of the Lockdown Regulations, particularly the limits on movement and restricted times of public transport, as well as the diversion of resources to combating the Covid-19 crisis. I am concerned by this drop in HIV testing as about 70 000 people die of HIV/Aids every year in South Africa, which is far more than the likely deaths from Covid-19. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2',114,'0','0']));Extra effort needs to be made whilst continuing the fight against Covid-19 to ensure that HIV testing resumes at a high level in order to diagnose cases in time to save lives from HIV/Aids.
