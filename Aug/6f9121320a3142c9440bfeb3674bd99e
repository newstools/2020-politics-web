Business for Ending Lockdown rejects continued state of disaster  15 August 2020 Business for Ending Lockdown (B4EL) notes President Ramaphosa's announcement of a move to lockdown level 2 commencing 17 August. While the further relaxing of restrictions is an improvement compared to remaining at level 3, B4EL will not thank the government for giving back to the people of South Africa that which belongs to them already. B4EL is a campaign to completely end lockdown. The campaign was founded this week. It is supported by several of the most well-known and largest business organisations, already counting almost 60 000 businesses.

The state of disaster allows the government to exert ultimate control over the economy, with the power to arbitrarily restrict freedoms and economic activity as it pleases. It also means less scrutiny on state tenders and procurement, allowing for a greater scope of state corruption. As long as the state of disaster is in place, investors and businesses have insufficient assurance and confidence to kick-start long-term investment and hiring. The lockdown continues to restrict the essential economic freedoms of too many South Africans to travel, trade, provide services, and earn a living: eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_5',114,'0','0']));Business trips, holidays and family visits overseas remain completely banned. The sale of alcohol remains restricted. Much of the entertainment industry remains shut down and unable to earn a living. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','0']));The entire country remains subject to a curfew. Onerous health and safety regulations remain in place which further restrict activity and limit risk management options. This is why B4EL remains resolute in our demands to: end the lockdown immediately; lift the state of disaster; and eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-banner-1','ezslot_2',116,'0','0']));allow people and organisations to manage their unique risks by converting all Covid-19 regulations into non-compulsory recommendations.
