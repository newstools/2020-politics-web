Ending the state of disaster, rebuilding society is up to us 15 August 2020 The state of disaster is the real disaster. It has been caused by a government which appropriated emergency powers and is unwilling to give them up. The damage won’t stop at level 2 and – if left alone – will remain long after Covid-19 has passed. “We call upon our members, other business owners, other business organisations, and civil society, to recognise that this is not a disaster that will pass by itself. Government will not, of its own accord, admit its mistakes or give up the powers that it has acquired. Tonight’s announcements by President Cyril Ramaphosa is the result of pressure by independent business and civil society. Keeping up the pressure, and rebuilding economy and society is up to us,” says Piet le Roux, CEO of Sakeliga. “There is only one way out of this disaster: more business, and less politics.” Sakeliga will study the regulations and coordinate with other organisations opposed to lockdown on further steps. In the meantime, we ask that all businesses do the following: Assume that the state is not going to help you Support Business for Ending Lockdown by signing at www.endlockdown.co.za Do whatever you need to do to stay in business, provided it is constitutional and just Not report anyone for ignoring an unconstitutional and unjust regulation Issued by Piet le Roux, CEO, Sakeliga, 15 August 2020
