DA welcomes freezing of fishy Gauteng PPE companies 21 August 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomes the court order obtained yesterday by the SIU to freeze the bank accounts of at least 40 fishy companies linked to irregular R2 billion PPE tenders by the Gauteng Department of Health. Frozen accounts include Ledla Structural Development, Royal Bhaca Projects and Mediwaste. This speedy action is critical to recovering as much money as possible before it is spent or disappears to other accounts. I also welcome the interdict on the pension fund of former Gauteng Health Department Chief Financial Officer, Kabelo Lehloenya. My concern is that implicated department officials surely had politically connected accomplices who should also be investigated and their finances scrutinised for undue enrichment. The net should be widened to include all those vultures who sought to profit from Covid-19 emergency procurement. They should not be allowed to get away with the loot and should be criminally charged as soon as possible. Issued by Jack Bloom, DA Gauteng Shadow MEC for Health, 21 August 2020
