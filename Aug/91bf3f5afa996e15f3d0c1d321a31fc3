The meeting was convened by Honourable Sibhidla-Saphetha in her capacity as the Chairperson of Agriculture and Rural Development and Honourable Mthethwa who is the Chairperson of Community Safety Portfolio Committee.

Rule 153 clearly states that only the Chairperson of a committee may make media statement and broadcast or internet and other electronic publications on behalf of a committee. The Rule further adds that Media Statements, broadcasts, internet or other electronic publications, whether made by the Chairperson pursuant to sub-rule(1) or by individual Members may not:eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_4',114,'0','0'])); i) Misrepresent any proceedings or reports of a committee or any documents, evidence, submissions or information before a committee or the views of other Members; or ii) Purport to represent the views or a report of a committee where it does not. Committee Members were shocked at Pappas’ misrepresentations of the committee deliberations including his assertion that “the DA is pleased to have the support of the SAPS in its campaign to declare farm murders a hate crime”.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_1',115,'0','0'])); The committee has resolved to investigate the contents of Pappas’ statement and take appropriate action. Once the committee has taken resolutions on this matter it will make these available to the public.
