DA welcomes the long-overdue reinstating of charges against Jiba  16 August 2020eval(ez_write_tag([[468,60],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0'])); The Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomes the decision to reinstate perjury charges against former Acting National Director of Public Prosecutions, Nomgcobo Jiba, for lying under oath. This is long overdue. It is in the interests of justice and accountability to prosecute Ms Jiba for her total disregard for the rule of law, and her gross abuse of power while occupying that position. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));This is good news for South Africa, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) and the criminal justice system as a whole. Her flagrant disregard for her oath of office must be visited with severe consequences. Prosecuting is an honourable profession and prosecutors must always conduct themselves in line with their oath. Ms Jiba was supposed to have gone to trial back in 2015 for allegedly lying under oath in the Booysen matter - but shortly after he was appointed as National Director of Public Prosecutions, Shaun Abrahams (and or Marshall Mokgathle) put a stop to the case and promoted Jiba instead. Three Pretoria High Court judges ruled against a decision by Shaun Abrahams to drop the charges against Jiba, obliging the NPA to reinstate the case. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));Based on statements by amongst others Jiba, Hawks head Johan Booysen was wrongfully prosecuted for racketeering. However, a Durban High Court Judge Trevor Gorven threw the charges out and agreed with Booysen that Jiba had lied. To fight corruption, we need to ensure that we transform the NPA into the bastion it once was, and also hold to account those who are still there, enjoying all the perks of well-remunerated employment,  who ignored their constitutional duties and actively contributed to the capture of the NPA.  This is a first step.  There is still much work to be done.
