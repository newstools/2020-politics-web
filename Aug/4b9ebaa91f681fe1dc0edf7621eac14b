DA condemns MEC Maile's public spat with resident 10 August 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));The Democratic Alliance (DA) calls on Gauteng Premier David Makhura to haul Cooperative Governance MEC Lebogang Maile before a disciplinary committee for threatening a frustrated Tshwane resident who was merely seeking help regarding his electricity being cut off. Maile told the resident in a series of text messages that he would "deal with him" and called him an "Askari”, in addition to using other derogatory words. The DA condemns this incident with utmost contempt, as Maile's behaviour is unbecoming of a senior public representative. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));The Tshwane resident can hardly be blamed for contacting MEC Maile directly, as the ANC's unlawfully imposed administrators have remained invisible while service delivery collapses in the city. It is becoming the norm for ANC politicians to abuse their powers by threatening and insulting those that disagree with them. In a recent incident ANC parliamentarian Boy Mamabolo threatened to shoot a journalist. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));The DA has noted Maile's apology, but his behavior goes way beyond a public apology and needs decisive action from the Gauteng Premier.
