The announcement was made by Eskom on Monday 3 August 2020. ‘The funds were lost in a concerted effort corruptly to divert financial resources from Eskom, to improperly and illegally benefit the Gupta family and entities controlled by the said family and their associates during their 2015-16 acquisition of the operations of Optimum Coal Holdings Limited (OCH)’, said Eskom in its statement announcing the step to recover ‘approximately R3.8 billion in funds illegally diverted from Eskom to help the Gupta family and its associates to acquire the operations of OCH’. The recovery is a step in the right direction. However, the SACP calls upon relevant law enforcement agencies to arrest those implicated in looting at Eskom, including the directors, executives and staff of foreign-controlled multinational corporations who were involved in the theft and received the proceeds of the loot. The SACP wants to see a successful prosecution that results in those found guilty wearing orange overalls. Assets and funds owned by such individuals that are associated with the looting, must be retrieved by the Asset Forfeiture Unit.
