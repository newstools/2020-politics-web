DA legal team will act if ANC administrators attempt to fill political posts  13 August 2020eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_4',112,'0','0'])); The Democratic Alliance (DA's) legal team has written to the ANC head administrator illegally deployed in Tshwane, to prevent the filling of a series of political posts, pending the current court proceedings which seeks to remove these same administrators from office. The DA has learnt with dismay that less than a week before the Section 18(4) Supreme court of Appeal hearing to remove them from office the ANC administrators have advertised a series of senior political posts on six month fixed contracts. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0']));This is totally unacceptable. The ANC administrators have already over-stayed their welcome in Tshwane as they were only constitutionally allowed to be in the city for 3 months. They will also be facing another Constitutional Court case on 10 September where the DA will continue to assert that their entire deployment to the city was unlawful. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));The fact that they are now attempting to make appointments on a six month basis is a total abuse of power. One of these positions is advertised as a “private secretary to the head administrator” with an attached salary of approximately R1 – R1.3 million. The only responsibilities attached to this post in the advert are: eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_2',115,'0','0']));To provide a reception service; To provide an office administration service; To provide a typing and computer operating service; To provide an operational logistics service; and To execute diverse official secretarial duties. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-banner-1','ezslot_5',116,'0','0']));This is an outrageous waste of taxpayers money and a slap in the face of Tshwane residents, many of whom are facing financial difficulties. The city has grappled with weeks of labour unrest due to pay disputes and now the head administrator is advertising secretarial posts with salaries over R1 million. It is a disgrace. The ANC head administrator Mpho Nawa must withdraw these adverts and focus his attention and that of his deployed cadres on restoring service delivery in the capital which is currently in chaos.
