EFF statement on case opened against corrupt Eskom COO Jan Oberholzer  31 July 2020eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_5',112,'0','0'])); The Economic Freedom Fighters has opened a case of corruption against disgraced Eskom COO Jan Oberlhozer. The case was opened by the EFF Deputy President Floyd Shivambu and EFF Treasure General Omphile Maotwe, this comes after damning revelations of Oberholzer's nepotism, bullying and compromising of Eskom's finances for the benefit of companies he has a material stake in. Oberlhozer was found by an internal inquiry to have actively promoted the interest of Aveng, a company that has conducted business with Eskom, and which is now litigating against Eskom, by instructing a subordinate to pay the company an amount of R42 million. This goes against Eskom policy, and he was found to have been in breach of the good faith he owes to his employer. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_3',113,'0','0']));The report also finds that Oberlhozer did not excuse himself from deliberations that concerned Stefanutti Stocks, a company he has shares on. It is now common knowledge that Stefanutti Stocks got an overpayment of an amount of RI billion from Eskom. To this day, there has been no proper explanation as to why this happened not has there been any disciplinary process to investigate this palpable conflict of interest. Jan Oberholzer is a known bully, who victimizes and demotes whistleblowers and those who stand against his corruption within the administration of Eskom. He has been found to have pressurized an employee to find a job for his brother-in-law Gregory Jacobs and is known to use foul language against employees who do not comply with his corrupt instructions. Notably, he has moved a whistleblower to a training job against his will because of his shenanigans being exposed and reported. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_4',114,'0','0']));No action has been taken against Oberlhozer for this clear and flagrant disregard of Eskom policy, due process and nepotism. Rather, he has been publicly defended by Eskom leadership to a point where his ally Pravin Gordhan has publicly declared that not all corruption is criminal, a declaration to absolve white corruption within State-Owned Enterprises. The EFF does not subscribe to the fear of white people, nor will we allow the protection of corruption just because it is done by white people. There is no other logical explanation for why Oberlhozer is allowed to operate with impunity besides the fact that the colour of his skin absolves him from disciplinary and criminal process. Oberlhozer is presiding over an Eskom that is failing to provide electricity to the nation in a time of a global pandemic, and this is precisely because he is bleeding the entity dry to enrich himself and his family. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_1',115,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_2',115,'0','1']));The EFF has therefore opened a case of corruption against Oberlhozer, and we reiterate our call for his immediate removal from Eskom. His continued presence confirms that there is a deliberate agenda to collapse the entity and present it as unsustainable through the means of constant electricity blackouts, in order to ease its sale to the friends of Pravin Gordhan and Cyril Ramaphosa. The case number for the charge against Oberlhozer is: CAS 468/7/2020. Issued by Vuyani Pambo, National Spokesperson, EFF, 31 July 2020
