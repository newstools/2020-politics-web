Gauteng learners will not receive dignitary packs and school uniforms during the 2020/21 financial year 20 August 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[468,60],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng notes with great concern that learners across Gauteng will not receive any dignitary packs and school uniforms during the 2020/21 financial year. This information was revealed by the Gauteng Department of Social Development in a presentation to the Gauteng Provincial Legislature’s (GPL) Social Development Portfolio Committee during a virtual meeting. According to the department’s fund reprioritizations in the special adjustment budget for the 2020/21 financial year, R83 million has been reprioritized from the dignitary packs to food parcels as well as R25 million from school uniforms to food parcels. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));The department claims that due to the fact the schools were closed due to the lockdown as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic they could not locate learners who are beneficiaries of the dignitary packs and as a result were unable to deliver this service. This clearly indicates that the department does not have a database of the contact details of the beneficiaries. This is worrying in terms of how these dignitary packs are being distributed which means that those learners that need them the most are unable to access this service when schools are closed. In total R108 million has been transferred to food parcels and whilst there is a need for food security in this province we are deeply saddened because menstruation does not disappear because there is a lockdown. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_4',114,'0','0']));Wherever these learners are, they still need dignitary packs (dignity packs include menstruation pads, products for people living with albinism) and as the schools open during and after the lockdown, learners will still require school uniforms. It is high time that the department considers the plight of these underprivileged learners who are in dire need of dignitary packs and school uniforms as most parents have been hit hard by this lockdown.Female learners dignity is being trampled on when it should be protected. The DA calls on the Gauteng MEC for Social Development, MEC Mokgethi to reconsider the department’s fund reprioritisation in the special adjustment budget for the 2020/21 financial year to ensure that our learners’ needs are taken care of.
