As per the guidelines provided in the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA), the MEC for Finance is designated to appoint the board members and accounting officers of subsidiaries such as Signal Developments, that fall under the North West Development Corporation (NWDC). eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));It is alleged that MEC Mosenogi appointed Mr Mojaki in March this year and, even after obtaining legal advice that substantiated this irregularity in April, she only withdrew the appointment in August after the DA pressed for answers. During a recent DEDECT portfolio committee meeting, it was revealed that R6.5 million was transferred to Signal Developments. This after the entity has been dormant for years with no mention of any prospects in the NWDC Corporate Plan for the 2019/20 financial year. The MEC seemingly abused her powers for political gain and therefore the DA will submit written questions, asking her to give a full report of why such a large amount was paid to a dormant entity, what the R6.5 million was spent on and also the reasons for appointing a controversial figure such as Mr Mojaki, details on the salary paid to him and also how this amount will be recovered. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));The DA will lodge a case with the Public Protector to investigate the irregular appointment, the salary Mr Mojaki received during his appointment and also the details surrounding the withdrawal of the appointment.
