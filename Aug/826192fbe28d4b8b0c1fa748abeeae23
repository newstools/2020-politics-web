Lifestyle audits needed for ANC Gauteng politicians 3 August 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));Lifestyle audits are urgently needed for ANC Gauteng politicians in the wake of the PPE contracts scandal, starting with suspended Health MEC Bandile Masuku who is alleged in a twitter post to have recently bought a palatial house for R9 million in cash. The post can be seen here. The sources of Masuku’s wealth needs to be disclosed if this house purchase is confirmed. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));I am reminded of the R7.2 million house in Bryanston that former Health MEC Brian Hlongwa bought in 2008 that court documents reveal was partly funded by companies that got contracts from the health department. Premier David Makhura promised lifestyle audits for all ANC MPLs in Gauteng more than two years ago, but nothing has happened to carry this out. I am aware that it is easy to make false allegations on social media, but much of this is believed because of deep public cynicism about ANC politicians on the take. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));Public trust can only be recovered if all public officials are vetted for suspicious sources of income. The DA in the Western Cape has pioneered lifestyle audits for its MECs, and Makhura should follow suit without poor excuses for delay in this matter.
