Where's DD? Surgeon General must clarify Deputy President Mabuza’s health condition 18 August 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) calls on the Surgeon General of South Africa, Lieutenant-General Zola Dabula, to give urgent public clarity on the state of Deputy President David Mabuza’s health. The Deputy President was due in the National assembly on Thursday to answer oral questions from MPs as well as an urgent question from the DA Shadow Minister of Health, SiviweGwarube MP, on the status of Covid-19 corruption investigations. Deputy President Mabuza’s office has sent an excuse to Parliament, once again stating his ill health as the reason for non-attendance. The session on Thursday is essential in ensuring the Executive is held to account, and as Leader of Government Business in Parliament, the Deputy President must avail himself to give account of the brazen Covid-19 corruption of his party, the ANC, and government. This is especially important as it is not the first time the Deputy President has used ill health as an excuse to miss Parliamentary question sessions. Earlier this year he missed meetings of the National Council of Provinces and the National Assembly due to ill health. Yet whenever his office is questioned on the matter, the standard response is that there is nothing wrong with the Deputy President’s health. So, where is DD Mabuza? He is either seriously ill, and his office is trying to hide that fact, or there is nothing wrong with him and he is simply trying to avoid accountability by claiming ill health whenever he is called to Parliament. South Africans deserve an explanation. Issued bySolly Malatsi,DA Shadow Minister in the Presidency, 18 August 2020
