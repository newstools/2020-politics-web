DA welcomes the appointment of Cricket South Africa’s Acting CEO 19 August 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomes the appointment of Kugandrie Govender as Acting Chief Executive officer (CEO) of Cricket South Africa (CSA). Her appointment follows the resignation of Jacques Faul, who resigned from the post on recently. We wish her well, especially in light of the difficult period that the CSA management is going through. The DA cautions the Minister of Sports, Arts and Culture, Nathi Mthethwa to stop interfering in sports administrations, and that the threats he made during his live broadcast towards CSA on transformation is the last thing the sport needs. We firmly believe and maintain that the best competent person should be appointed for a position, and  that politics should not interfere in sport. Transformation has helped many sportsman and woman to excel to achieve national colours, but they must achieve it on merit. Issued by Willem Faber, DA Deputy Shadow Minister of Sports, Arts and Culture, 19 August 2020
