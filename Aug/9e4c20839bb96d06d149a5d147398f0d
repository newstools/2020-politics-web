DA-led Midvaal the best performing municipality in Gauteng 10 August 2020 Please find an attachment on the financial sustainability of municipalities from Ratings Afrika here. The Democratic Alliance (DA) applauds the DA-led Midvaal Municipality for continuing its good governance practices and managing its financial resources in a sustainable manner. This can be seen in the Ratings Afrika annual Municipal Financial Sustainability Index (MFSI), released on Friday for the financial results of the 100 largest municipalities in the country. The MFSI is a scoring model that evaluates six components of municipalities, including the operating performance, liquidity management, debt governance, budget practices, affordability and infrastructure development of a municipality, and scores these out of 100. DA-led Midvaal, with a score of 66, has demonstrated consistency during the past five years with good budgetary practices, strict financial control and good revenue collection, despite the current economic conditions. Where the DA governs, we will do our utmost to ensure that taxpayers’ money is spent on delivering services efficiently to our communities. The DA commends Mayor Baloyi and his team, and most of all we thank the residents of Midvaal for their support. Issued by John Moodey, DA Gauteng Provincial Leader, 10 August 2020
