SAHRC to investigate EFF Councillor behind race-baiting @TracyZille account 26 August 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomes the decision by the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) to pursue our complaint against the man behind the race-baiting @TracyZille Twitter account, Anthony Matumba. The Commission today confirmed to the DA that it would institute the matter at the Equality Court. Matumba, who is an EFF Councillor in Limpopo, pretended to be a white woman, Tracy Zille, and posted several racial incendiary tweets aimed at spurring on racial discontent. The utterances on the @TracyZille account sought to demean Black South Africans, whilst at the same time vilifying white South Africans. The DA is of the view that this is tantamount to hate speech and we are pleased that this matter will now be tested before the Equality Court. While the DA is committed to every South African’s right to freedom of speech, we cannot sit by and watch as someone willfully attempts to incite and deepen South Africa’s already fractured race relations.
