We send our condolences to their family and friends at this time. Focus on the unemployment pandemic: Earlier today, I participated in the President’s Coordinating Council meeting where I put forward the Western Cape’s position that we must urgently turn our focus to the second pandemic of unemployment and the humanitarian crisis that have been the result of a prolonged lockdown period in South Africa. Businesses who can operate safely must be allowed to do so. The alcohol ban which has also had a significant impact on the agricultural, agri-processing and hospitality industries should also be lifted, in conjunction with smart interventions aimed at reducing the harmful effects of alcohol on our society. We have already seen major job losses as a result of the pandemic’s effects on our economy. As a country and as a province we must do everything possible to protect jobs, and grow our economy so that we can start to create new ones. In the Western Cape, we have overcome the peak of infections, and we are seeing a decline in the numbers of infections, hospitalisations and deaths. Our healthcare system, bolstered by four field hospitals and additional healthcare interventions such as high flow nasal oxygen, has been able to provide appropriate care to everyone who needed it, and now has spare capacity. I believe that President Cyril Ramaphosa, his cabinet and the various advisory councils understand the severity of the problem we currently face and the need for urgent and decisive action to change our course. We eagerly await the outcomes of President Ramaphosa’s deliberations and the announcements he will make tonight. The reopening of our economy will require every individual, business and industry to take responsibility, to act responsibly and to ensure that safety is always top of mind to ensure that we continue to contain and slow the spread of Covid-19. Red Dot Taxi Service: The Red Dot Taxi Service, has since its launch in May this year, provided approximately 47 000 trips for healthcare workers, covering over 730 000 km and servicing 25 healthcare centres across the province. It has also undertaken over 8600 trips to and from isolation facilities across the province. The Red Dot Taxi Service is a partnership between the Western Cape Government and the taxi industry, which provides safe, reliable transport to and from work for healthcare workers, and also provides a service to and from our quarantine and isolation sites for people making use of them. During this pandemic, our healthcare workers have been the first line of defense and it was vitally important that we were able to provide them with a transport service that was reliable, and safe. The Red Dot Taxis only carry limited loads, are sanitized between each trip and have protective measures in place for drivers and passengers. Throughout the pandemic, the Western Cape Government has sought to build partnerships- with industries, businesses, NGOs and with individuals. This partnership with the taxi industry was a first in South Africa and has played an important role in helping to slow the spread of COVID-19. It is my hope that the Department of Transport and Public Works and industry representatives continue to build on this relationship going forward, to find new ways to innovate and to ultimately benefit the people of this province. I would like to thank all of the operators and drivers who have been a part of this project for coming on board, and for working with us on this project.

More data is available here: https://coronavirus.westerncape.gov.za/covid-19-dashboard Special focus on diabetics helping to save lives: The Western Cape has recorded an additional 26 deaths, bringing the total number of COVID-19 related deaths in the province to 3528. We send our condolences to their family and friends at this time. Our focus on high-risk patients, and specifically diabetics, continues with promising early feedback. The project ensures that when a diabetic patient tests positive for COVID-19, the Department of Health makes daily contact with them. For high risk diabetics, we also encourage admission to the CTICC Hospital of Hope in order to monitor their health. Over the past two weeks, 39 high-risk diabetic patients have been contacted, and admitted to hospital with only two deaths recorded. This is especially promising, as the background mortality for this group is considerably higher, and at least 37%. We currently still have 18 of these patients still admitted at the Hospital of Hope where they are being closely monitored. The remaining 19 have been discharged and are recovering will at home. Since the 7th of August, we have also started the phase of the project focusing on low risk diabetics with COVID-19. Since the 7th of August, more than 60 patients have been contacted by a group of dedicated young doctors, and they are being followed up daily. Of this group- 13 have been referred for a more intense follow up by a medical officer for the remainder of their COVID-19 period. This focus on those people who are at greatest risk of severe illness and death, means that we are able to intervene early and ensure that proper treatment is given. While it is still early, the results we have seen show that this focus is saving lives. The Western Cape has seen positive signs as the numbers of new infections, hospitalisations and death are declining but it remains of utmost importance that we protect ourselves and our loved ones. This is especially important if you are in one of the high risk groups, or if you are in regular contact with a family member, or colleague who is high risk. We can do this by continuing to wear our masks, practicing social distancing and ensuring that we keep up good hygiene practices such as hand washing, coughing into a tissue, an arm or an elbow, and regularly cleaning high traffic surfaces. If you are over the age of 55, diabetic or have an underlying comorbidity such as hypertension, or heart kidney or lung disease, and are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, it is important to get tested early. If you experience chest pains, or trouble breathing, seek immediate medical attention. Issued by Western Cape Office of the Premier, 15 August 2020
