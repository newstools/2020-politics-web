THE FIVE GUILTY OF MURDER OF DA COUNCILOR AND NOUSE GET HEAVY SENTENCES Four of men of the five accused of murder of a councilor for the Democratic Alliance (DA), Johannes Baatjies, and his friend Jeffry Nouse, were sentenced to double life imprisonment by the Kimberly High Court. The four accused are Frank Baxane, 2onizelo Magawu, Charles Mphondomisa and Matthews Legodu. The fifth accused, Richard Hasane, was sentenced 36 years imprisonment for his part in the crimes. They were found guilty of murder and conspiring to kill Baartjies. The motive was to ensure that Baatjies is stopped from being sworn in as a DA councillor. The High Court was told that on the day of the assassination of Baatjies and Nouse, the two were lured to a bogus business meeting for a transaction of about R800 000. Instead of striking a deal, the victims were shot on the road between Danielskuil and Postmasburg on their way to the meeting. Mr. Baatjies was shot numerous times and died on the scene while Nouse died later in hospital. The Judge when sentencing the five accused, emphasised the seriousness of the charges against them, and that the court had taken into consideration that the accused were first time offenders. Owing to the accused lack of remorse, it was difficult for the court to give them any lesser punishment. Richard Hasane received 18 years for each count because he became part of the plot later. He provided transport to the killers. The prosecution, led by Advocate Johannes Cloete, believed that the sentences were satisfactory and will be a deterrent to would be lawbreakers. The NPA also said it hoped the sentencing of these perpetrators will also provide closure to the families of the victims who continued to suffer due to the loss of their loved ones in 2016.
