This means that in some instances, cases could be allocated to the wrong sub-districts. We are working with the sub-districts to clean and verify the data and where errors are picked up locally, cases will be re-allocated to the correct areas. More data is available here: https://coronavirus.westerncape.gov.za/covid-19-dashboard(link is external) The Western Cape has recorded an additional 40 deaths, bringing the total number of COVID-19 related deaths in the province to 3801. We send our condolences to their family and friends at this time. Mitchell's Plain business visit: Today, I had visited some businesses in Mitchell's Plain to chat to them about their business, some of their concerns and the impact of the lockdown. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_6',115,'0','0']));My first stop was dressmaker Suraya Williams - whose Design 26 foundation teaches young women from the community sewing skills. Her business, which makes women's clothing and custom matric ball dresses, has been heavily impacted by the lockdown. As a result, she has had to pivot to making masks and running her business as a small-scale CMT business. I salute Ms Williams for doing what was necessary to continue to operate, but many other small businesses have not been able to stay open. We need to get our economy growing again, so that we can save jobs and address the second pandemic of unemployment, hunger and increased levels of poverty. This is a top priority for the Western Cape Government, as we work on our recovery plan. I also visited Marshall Nelson who provides skills training for young people in Mitchells Plain. He and his children started 3D printing protective face shields during the lockdown which they distributed in their community - using their available equipment and innovation to help slow the spread of COVID-19. Then, I popped into the Eve and Steve hair salon in the Promenade Mall. I had my first haircut here after salons were first allowed to open under alert level 3 and returned today for a trim. I was pleased to see that the business is still taking all the necessary safety precautions to operate safely. I also had the opportunity to walk around the mall and to engage with the mall management. As with my visit to the Cape Town CBD last week, I noticed that some businesses were quieter an others had closed their doors. I was however pleased to hear that while some spaces were to let- there were some new tenants coming in as well. At the same time, my community liaison team, "Team Premier" were on the ground engaging with businesses in the Garden Route today. They were sharing information about the golden rules of hygiene, as well as distributing masks and informational posters to businesses. Tomorrow, they will also be joined by Minister of Human Settlements Tertuis Simmers who is the hotspot lead for the Garden Route as well as representatives from local government. Over the coming weeks and months, I hope to visit many more businesses and areas as the Western Cape Government focuses on its recovery. It will take some time for businesses to rebuild and to regain what was lost during the lockdown. I therefore continue to appeal to everyone to support a small or a local business wherever they can to help to protect jobs. Whether it be buy buying your fruit and vegetables from a local vendor,  buying locally produced clothing, or going out for a meal or a coffee, you can help to support a business and the jobs that they create. You can also help to support small businesses without spending a cent by reviewing them on social media or by recommending them to family, friends and colleagues. But please remember to do this safely, by always following the golden rules.
