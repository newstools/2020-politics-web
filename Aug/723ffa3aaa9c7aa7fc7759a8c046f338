MEC Mazibuko failed to set up a single virtual meeting with the SAPS Gauteng leadership over the last three months 27 August 2020 The Gauteng Department of Community Safety has failed to set up even a single virtual meeting with the Gauteng SAPS leadership over the last three months. This information was revealed in the department’s first quarter report for the 2020/2021 financial year. According to the first quarter report, the department had a target of preparing and presenting specifications to the Bid Specification Committee and Bid Adjudication Committee with regards to the procurement of 35 high powered police vehicles, 17 bakkies and 4 mobile police stations. This target was not achieved, and the reasons given by the department for not achieving this target is that the process is dependent on SAPS. Escalating Covid-19 infections made it impossible to secure a virtual meeting with SAPS leadership. This is ridiculous and clearly indicates the severity of this department’s incompetency. Since the president declared the state of disaster most of the institutions particularly government institutions have been engaging with stakeholders and hosting virtual meetings to ensure that work is done, and services are rendered to our people. The meeting with the SAPS leadership is important and should have been prioritised by the department instead of using Covid-19 as an excuse. The Democratic Alliance (DA) will hold MEC Mazibuko to account for failing to set up a virtual meeting with SAPS leadership as this has resulted in a delay in the process of procuring much needed policing vehicles and mobile police stations to enhance service delivery.
