Tshwane billing confusion and labour unrest plagues residents 5 August 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_3',112,'0','0']));Labour unrest continues in the City of Tshwane as complaints pour in to Democratic Alliance (DA) representatives about billing errors. This comes as the unlawful ANC administrators in Tshwane start implementing the city’s new budget. Residents are receiving outrageously high bills, which far exceed the meter readings they have submitted. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0']));Multiple cases of residents having paid their accounts in full and then receiving notification that they will be cut off if they do not pay their accounts are also being reported. Some residents are reporting bills that are up to ten times what they would normally pay. Unable to get answers from the city’s unlawful ANC administrators to correct these failures, they are being threatened with having their electricity cut off. It is deeply concerning that already within the first month of implementing the city’s new budget there are dozens of complaints of errors being made on the billing of residents in the city. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_4',114,'0','0']));Under the ANC administrators the city is also bleeding cash due to under-collections of revenue, with an estimated 30% of customers not paying their accounts on time. If the city fails to issue bills correctly this will likely increase as residents will refuse to pay the exorbitant and incorrect bills that are being levied. This will further aggravate the already strained financial situation in which the unlawful ANC administrators have placed the city. These failures merely add to the litany of challenges facing residents in the city as service delivery falters under the unlawful ANC administrators. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_1',115,'0','0']));Failure to address the current labour unrest has crippled the city’s core administrative functions, and residents are unable to get any assistance.
