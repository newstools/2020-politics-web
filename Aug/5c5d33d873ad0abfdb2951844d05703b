DA urges parents to send their children back to school 25 August 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng is urging parents to send their children back to school as schools have re-opened for more grades on the 24th August 2020. The Gauteng Department of Education has an obligation to ensure the safety of both learners and teachers during this national lockdown period as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Gauteng school attendance rate based on grade 7 and 12 is currently at 78 percent and we should avoid learners dropping out by ensuring that all learners go back to school. Those parents who will not be sending their children back to school must apply for home schooling immediately so that their children do not miss a day of schooling. It is compulsory for any child of school going age to access basic quality education. The DA will hold the department accountable to ensure that all schools adhere to health regulations and provide quality PPEs to both learners and teachers. The department should ensure that all schools have adequate Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) so that learning and teaching will not be disrupted. The DA will continue to monitor teaching and learning during this difficult period and ensure that the department provides all our schools with all the necessities required to ensure the safety of our learners and teachers. All other organizations must work with the department to ensure that we provide necessary support to both learners and teachers under these difficult circumstances.
