EFF statement on the Eldorado Park murder of a sixteen-year-old boy by a police officer 28 August 2020 The Economic Freedom Fighters is saddened by the death of the sixteen-year-old boy Nathaniel Julius from Eldorado Park, South of Johannesburg. We send our sincere and deepest condolences to the family of the deceased. It is reported that the sixteen-year-old teenager was shot dead on Wednesday, 26 August 2020 by a police officer. This horrific incident sparked a protest which saw the local residents of Eldorado Park rightfully taking it to the streets in demand for justice for the deceased and against corrupt police. The Police are there to protect and defend the citizens of this country, not to terrorise and ill us. This growing use of excessive use of force is a growing phenomenon that must come to an end. We have seen it in Alexandra with the death of Collins Khosa when the soldiers fetched him in his home to send him directly to an early grave. Today in Eldorado Park, a child is killed by a rogue, cruel thug in police uniform, salaried by the taxpayers. We demand the police who shot and killed the innocent child to be suspended with immediate effect. The police officer must be immediately put to jail with no bail, and he must be criminally prosecuted. As the EFF, we will make sure that the deceased finds justice, and we will not rest until his killers are in jail. We will not tolerate or entertain any report post investigations that seeks to whitewash the actions of the police like the SANDF did with the case of Collins Khosa, like the Marikana Commission did with the murder of the 34 mine workers in Marikana.
