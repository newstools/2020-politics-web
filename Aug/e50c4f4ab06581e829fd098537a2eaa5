ANC statement dismissing as fake news claims on Secretary General Ace Magashule 25 August 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));The African National Congress (ANC) condemns in the strongest possible terms the work of fake-news peddlers who are hellbent on sowing divisions within the ranks of the ANC. The latest installment comes from those who claim that ANC Secretary General, Comrade Ace Magashule, has distanced the ANC from President Cyril Ramaphosa's letter addressed to ANC members. We are aware that detractors thrive on divisions and despise harmony. It is clear that wedge-drivers who hate to see a united ANC are now on overdrive trying everything possible to undermine the collective resolve and unity of our leadership to fight corruption wherever it raises its ugly head. We wish to state unequivocally that the entire leadership of the ANC including the Secretary General, is in full support of the contents of the letter from President Ramaphosa as it reflects and represent the views of the collective. The letter from President Ramaphosa in fact echoes the resolutions and sentiments expressed by our 54th National Conference. We urge our structures and members to remain vigilant and defend the unity of their organisation against those who seek to weaken the ANC. The unity of our movement remains sacrosanct.
