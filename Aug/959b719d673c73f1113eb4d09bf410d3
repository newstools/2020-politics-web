DA welcomes the arrests of corrupt Tshwane Metro Police Officers  13 August 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng has learnt that 13 Tshwane Metro Police Department (TMPD) officers have been arrested for alleged corruption and soliciting bribes from motorists. It is alleged that some of the arrested metro police officers are linked to incidents of soliciting bribes from motorists along Hammanskraal on the N1 highway as well as around Garsfontein along Delmas road and Hatfield. The residents around these areas including the motorists driving along those roads have been complaining about metro police soliciting bribes. There have been unnecessary delays in reacting to these complaints about allegations of corruption against TMPD as well as delays in initiating internal investigations and disciplinary processes against corrupt officers. It is worrying that the metro police officers who have a duty to prevent crime, protect and ensure the safety of the public are committing crime. Such acts have resulted in people losing trust and confidence in law enforcement agencies. The DA calls on the Tshwane Administrator, Mpho Nawa to ensure that they maintain discipline within the TMPD. We will also closely monitor the progress of these cases to ensure that those found to be guilty of corruption should face the full might of the law. These cases should set a good example to the entire TMPD that there are severe consequences for corruption. For far too long the DA has been calling on the ANC-led government to do a complete overhaul of the law enforcement agencies by curbing corruption, hiring people with a passion for policing and retaining good police officers to make the police service honest , professional and one that serves and protects our people.
