DA calls on Gauteng Provincial Government to make its PPE tenders public  6 August 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng is calling on the Gauteng Provincial Government to publish its Procurement Disclosure Report that details all Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) procurement and expenditure in the province as a matter of urgency. The DA is making this call following the recent PPE scandal where it came to light that a tender to provide PPE to the Gauteng Health Department was awarded to a company owned by the husband of the spokesperson to President Cyril Ramaphosa. This will enable the public to know exactly who was awarded a tender to provide PPE to the Gauteng Provincial Government, which will allow for full transparency of the procurement process. Furthermore, it will also ensure that there is strict adherence to the Supply Chain Management processes that every government department should be adhering to. Where we govern in the Western Cape we have implemented pro-active support and compliance measures to mitigate procurement risks, which include the establishment of a Central Procurement Advisory Committee to support and advise the main procurement departments and enhanced surveillance of disaster-related procurement by internal audits of procurement transactions. If the MEC for Finance and e-Government, Nomantu Nkomo-Ralehoko is serious about ensuring that the tender process is transparent, then she will ensure that the Gauteng Provincial Government publishes its Procurement Disclosure Report immediately.
