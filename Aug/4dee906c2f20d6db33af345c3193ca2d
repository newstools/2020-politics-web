Covid-19 corruption: DA calls for Debate on a Matter of Public Importance 25 August 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));The Chief Whip of The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) has today called on KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Legislature Speaker, Nontembeko Boyce, to allow for an urgent debate on a Matter of Public Importance during the next parliamentary Sitting scheduled to take place on 3 September. The call comes in terms of Rule 102 of the Legislature Rules and relates to the recent, much-publicized allegations of corruption within the province, particularly when it comes to funding dedicated to the fight against Covid-19. KZN has received massive media coverage – none of which is positive - when it comes to how Covid-19 funding was spent by provincial government Departments. This is dedicated funding that was set aside specifically for the purpose of ensuring that our province was properly equipped to fight the global health pandemic. Yet it appears that there is more than enough evidence to show that the monies were not properly managed. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_11',113,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_12',113,'0','1']));It is the people of KZN who were supposed to benefit from this funding – not dodgy officials and politicians. The DA firmly believes that it is in the interests of the people of KZN that such a debate take place during next week’s Sitting. We urge the Speaker to accept our proposal. The ANC needs to account to the people of KZN.
