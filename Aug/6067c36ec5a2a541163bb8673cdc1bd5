DA will not bend the knee to Minister Mthethwa’s ridiculous threats 19 August 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[468,60],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));The Democratic Alliance (DA) rejects Minister of Sports, Arts and Culture, Nathi Mthethwa’s request for SA Rugby to take action against the eight players who did not kneel before the start of a rugby match this past weekend, in support of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) campaign. Minister Mthethwa’s request for an investigation is completely ridiculous and nothing short of a witchhunt aimed at vilifying those players for practising their constitutional rights of freedom of choice and freedom of association. It is exactly this kind of utterances by the Minister that divide us. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));No South African should be coerced to demonstrate support for any movement. South Africa is a Constitutional Democracy, and freedom of choice and freedom of association are fundamental rights. Minister Mthethwa is wide off the mark with his comments. His utterances will only serve to delegitimise the BLM movement he claims to support so deeply. If, how and when these players choose to show solidarity or support for the BLM movement, should be their choice. It is not for the Minister or the Government to police or vilify them.
