We send our condolences to their family and friends at this time. Women on the frontline: Today, as we commemorate Women's Day in South Africa, we thank those women who have been at the frontline of our response to COVID-19. We thank the thousands of women in our healthcare system, working as doctors, nurses, researchers, scientists, technicians, hospital cleaners, catering and administrative staff who ensure that the sick people of this province get the care that they need. We also thank all of those dedicated women who are teachers, school staff, social workers, sports coaches and law enforcement officers who are on the ground in our communities, making a difference in people's lives. I thank those women who patrol as members of a neighbourhood watch, who care for the children, the less fortunate and the elderly in their communities. We thank those women who are making meals to feed the hungry, the business leaders who are creating jobs and sharing their skills. The Western Cape's response to COVID-19 has been strengthened by the partnerships we have built with businesses, civil society, community groups and NGOs, many of which are led by women. We know that the extended lockdown has had a significant impact on women around the world resulting in job losses, economic hardships and an increased risk of gender based violence. As the Western Cape continues to fight COVID-19, we must also fight these two additional pandemics of unemployment and gender based violence which threaten the safety of women, and families and will impact generations to come.

MSF Thusong Hospital to close: Yesterday was the last day for new admissions to the Thusong field hospital in Khayelitsha, being operated by Medicins Sans Frontiers. The organization will now be extending its support to other provinces where cases are increasing and their services will have a greater impact. This hospital and all of the people who were involved in building and operating it, have been invaluable in our fight against COVID-19 in this province and we thank everyone who has played a part in saving lives there. This entire project has been the result of a partnership between MSF, the Western Cape Government, and the City of Cape Town who provided the building. These kinds of partnerships have been valuable throughout our COVID-19 response, but also demonstrate what is possible when we combine forces to tackle problems. The hospital, which opened its doors on 1 June, has admitted 241 people over the past two months. It has worked closely with the Khayelitsha Hospital, providing an invaluable service to the people of Khayelitsha. New infections in Khayelitsha have shown a decline in recent weeks. The recovery rate in Khayelitsha currently stands at over 90% and between the Khayelitsha hospital, and the Brackengate temporary facility, we will still be able to accept and care for patients as necessary. We thank the entire team for their hard work, and commitment and the important role they have played in saving lives in this province. We wish them well as they go on to do this in other places in South Africa. Preventing the second wave and the unemployment pandemic: The Western Cape has seen an overall decline in the number of hospitalisations in recent weeks and our hospitals are currently running at 69% of capacity.  Our field hospitals have played an important role in ensuring that we have been able to provide appropriate care for people in the province at the peak of infections. This also means that we are now able to start re-introducing other key services in our healthcare system which were either put on hold or slowed down because of COVID-19. Our hotspot interventions continue in all of our hotspot areas to promote behaviour change. Long term behaviour change is key to ensuring that we continue to see a decline in the numbers of new infections and hospitalisations and save lives. We do not want to see a second wave of infections, and so it is vitally important that we all continue to take precautions. These include staying at home as much as possible, especially if you fall into one of the high risk groups, regular handwashing, and hygiene practices such as not touching your face, and coughing into an arm or an elbow. Wearing your mask and social distancing when outside of your home can help to protect you and your loved ones from becoming ill. If you do feel sick, or are experiencing any symptoms, it is important that you stay home, and seek medical attention if you experience trouble breathing. Yesterday, the Western Cape cabinet announced that it has taken a position on allowing businesses to open safely, and for domestic alcohol sales to be allowed in the province. We will be communicating this position to the national government. As a province, we have all worked hard, together, to battle COVID-19 and we have made significant strides. If we all continue to take every effort to reduce the spread of this virus, we can not only protect the people of this province from COVID-19, but can begin to rebuild the economy and ensure that we are able to overcome the second pandemic of unemployment.

Western Cape cabinet adopts position on business opening and alcohol sales: The Western Cape cabinet has concluded its two daybosberaad where we have adopted the position that where business can open safely, they should be allowed to do so. Additionally, we have also adopted the position that domestic alcohol sales should be allowed, with smart recommendations in place. These positions have been taken with a view to reducing the impact of a second, equally dangerous pandemic- unemployment. We will now engage the national government on these positions.
