This means that in some instances, cases could be allocated to the wrong sub-districts. We are working with the sub-districts to clean and verify the data and where errors are picked up locally, cases will be re-allocated to the correct areas. More data is available here: https://coronavirus.westerncape.gov.za/covid-19-dashboard eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));The Western Cape has recorded an additional 21 deaths, bringing the total number of COVID-19 related deaths in the province to 3889. We send our condolences to their family and friends at this time. Brackengate Hospital of Hope: Today, I handed over the Hospital of Hope branding from the CTICC field hospital to the Brackengate facility. Following the closure of the hospital at the CTICC earlier this month, the Brackengate facility has become our main COVID-19 field hospital, and will take over the name of the Hospital of Hope. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_0',115,'0','0']));We saw so many inspiring stories come out the the CTICC, and we know that the Brackengate Hospital of Hope will produce many more stories of recovery, courage, care and commitment. This facility has 338 available beds, with eight of these able to provide high flow nasal oxygen. While we have seen the number of COVID-19 hospital admissions steadily declining over the past few weeks, this hospital will continue to play an important role in providing intermediate care to those who need it, for the foreseeable future. Combined with the additional bed capacity we have created in some of our rural hospitals, and available capacity in our main hospitals, we have sufficient capacity to both care for COVID-19 patients and roll out more of the healthcare services which were put on hold because of COVID-19. Archives and record services to reopen: After having received the correct approvals and having put in place all the required safety measures, the provincial Archives and Record Services in Roeland Street will reopen tomorrow. The archives are a valuable source of knowledge and information, detailing the history of the province and of its people. We are therefore very happy that researchers, and residents alike will once more be able to access this treasure trove of information.
