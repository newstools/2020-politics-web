UJ and HSRC researchers find support for the President’s handling of the pandemic response has diminished 18 August 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[468,60],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));As the country moves to lower lockdown levels, support for the President’s handling of the pandemic response has diminished by 24 percentage points, falling to 61%, a similar level of popularity pre-COVID-19. This is according to the online, multilingual COVID-19 Democracy Survey. The round two findings of the survey, conducted by researchers from the University of Johannesburg’s Centre for Social Change (CSC) and the Human Sciences Research Council’s Developmental, Capable and Ethical State division (DCES), will be released at a webinar on Wednesday, 19 August 2020 at 13h00. The survey reveals that the decline in confidence has occurred across the socioeconomic divide, ranging from a 15 percentage point drop among residents in informal settlements (86% to 71%) and students (77% to 62%) to a 49 percentage point decline among white adults (90% to 41%) and Indian adults (82% to 33%). eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));However, according to the HSRC’s DCES divisional head, Prof Narnia Bohler-Muller, the majority of South Africans are still willing to sacrifice their rights to slow the spread of COVID-19. The top of the list is the right to freedom of association – attending faith gatherings in churches, mosques, temples and so on. She says that South Africans are least willing to sacrifice their right to privacy. “People feeling angry, frustrated or sad are less likely to trust the President and less likely to sacrifice any rights to protect others. Those who feel fearful are more trusting of the President and more willing to sacrifice their rights to prevent the spread of the virus. “Our findings show that about 73% of adults comply with regulations, which is not enough to stop the spread of COVID-19, thus making it more likely that restrictions will have to be re-imposed,” says Prof Bohler-Muller. The data comprises 10,115 respondents for the first round of surveying, and 2,570 respondents for the first phase of the second round (3-17 July 2020). Results are broadly nationally representative, based on an opt-in sample using cellphones or computers, and weighted by race, education and gender to match Stats SA’s demographic data. Round 1 of the survey covered the early hard lockdown period and the early part of level 4 (13 April -13 May 2020). During the webinar, follow-up findings will be presented, looking at patterns of change among South Africans from a social sciences and humanities perspective.
