DA tables ground-breaking Gauteng Community Safety Oversight Bill 12 August 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng has tabled its Community Safety Oversight Bill in the Gauteng Legislature to strengthen and improve the South African Police Service (SAPS) ability to stem the growing crime pandemic that is sweeping across the province. The most recent crime statistics reveal that Gauteng is the second most dangerous place to live in South Africa. The Bill will not only increase oversight of the SAPS, but it will empower communities to hold the Executive and police to account. Communities that have been abandoned by the ANC-led Provincial Government will now have greater recourse to the law through increased powers devolved to Neighbourhood Watches and Community Police Forums. The Bill will go a long way to empower communities that live in non-urban and rural areas who are often hardest hit by crime yet are the most neglected. Through the Bill, the Civilian Secretariat will be further empowered, and the establishment of a Provincial SAPS Ombudsman will bring the often out of reach Executive closer to the people whom they are meant to serve. The DA firmly believes that the adoption of this Bill will allow the people of this province to play a more meaningful role in fighting crime and ensuring that those who have been victims of crime greater access to often out of reach justice. We will continue to work tirelessly to ensure the rights and safety of every resident of Gauteng are upheld and honoured. To access the bill, clickÂ here.
