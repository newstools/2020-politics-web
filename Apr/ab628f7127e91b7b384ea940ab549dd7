We are currently investigating the authenticity and origin of the picture to determine the identity of the persons in photograph as well as when and where the picture was taken. Such behaviour by any South African Police Service members is unacceptable and it is condemned in strongest terms by police management. As soon as the investigation is concluded and  the picture authenticated, the members will be subjected to internal disciplinary procedures. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));We are appealing anyone who has information about this picture to contact the SAPS Crime Stop number 086 00 10111.
