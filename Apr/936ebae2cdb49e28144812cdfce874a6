Absa and Dis-Chem join forces to give customers more “bang for their buck” 15 April 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));Absa Bank and Dis-Chem Pharmacies have today launched an alliance that will see Absa Rewards customers enjoy new benefits from Dis-Chem. From 1 May 2020, customers can earn up to 30% in real cash back of their spend on health and beauty products, a crucial benefit in these times of heightened health and hygiene awareness. “At Absa, we constantly look for ways to improve our already compelling rewards offering. Giving customers more value for money and stretching every Rand is exceedingly important, especially in these uncertain times. We are delighted to be teaming up with Dis-Chem to put back money in our customers’ pockets,” said Cowyk Fox, Managing Executive: Everyday Banking, Absa Retail and Business Bank. A partnership between South Africa’s leading pharmacy and one of the country’s largest banks was an obvious choice. “Partnering with like-minded brands for the benefit of our customers is a crucial part of Dis-Chem’s quest to constantly search for ways to enhance customers’ rewards and shopping experiences in our stores. We are confident that our partnership with Absa Rewards will benefit both our customers, as South Africans are increasingly stretched financially,” said Lynne Blignaut, Group Customer Service Manager at Dis-Chem. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));Simplicity and convenience are at the heart of this partnership. Absa Rewards and Dis-Chem customers can potentially earn up to 30% cash back on qualifying products in their shopping trolley at Dis-Chem or at any Absa Rewards grocery partner, nationwide. This partnership will also allow Dis-Chem and Absa to leverage their collective healthcare and financial know-how for the benefit of customers. Through a raft of initiatives, both Absa and Dis-Chem have been at the forefront of mitigating the health and financial impact of COVID-19 in South Africa. “As the country tries to alleviate the impact of COVID-19, Absa will augment its R10 million contribution to the Solidarity Fund by allowing Absa Rewards members to donate their rewards directly to the fund,” added Fox. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2',114,'0','0']));“Dis-Chem has also pledged R2 million to the Solidarity Fund and we are allowing customers to donate their Dis-Chem Benefit points to the fund, which we will also match Rand for Rand,” said Blignaut. The Solidarity Fund has been established by the South African government and seeks to support the most vulnerable in society during this trying period.
