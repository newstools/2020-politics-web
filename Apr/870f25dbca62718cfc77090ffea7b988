Government's relaxed regulations for Lockdown causes mass confusion 3 April 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));The IFP expresses grave displeasure at governments reported changes to the lockdown regulations just seven days in. Government must not kowtow to industries for monetary gain when lives are placed at greater risk and with very little information on how the lockdown is slowing down the transmission of Covid-19. The recent announcements by the Ministers following the National Coronavirus Command Council to governments published amended regulations to the state of disaster is causing mass confusion across the country. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));We have seen a number of mixed messages which have caused panic and anxiety amongst South Africans. Decisive action means that regulations cannot be bent and modelled according to the needs of industries. If government changes lockdown regulations weekly, we run the risk of merely fighting compliance to the regulations and buy-in from South Africans. We support the government in taking firm action but we call on the Ministers within the National Command Council to stick to the regulations as gazetted and to refrain from making “frivolous” changes. eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));At least 53,007 people globally have died from COVID-19 and 1,008,768 have been infected by coronavirus. South Africa is not immune to this and we should be unbending in our actions and regulations if we are to keep our citizens safe and protected. Travel should be limited – one message is more important than an array of mixed signals being issued by government. The IFP reiterates our call to South Africans to remain at home during this time. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','0']));If you think you have been exposed to the Covid-19 virus, please call the 24-hour hotline on 0800 029 999 or visit sacoronavirus.co.za Issued by Velenkosini Hlabisa MPL, IFP President, 3 April 2020
