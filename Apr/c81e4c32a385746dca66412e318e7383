Gauteng DSD fails to meet 48 hour turnaround time to distribute food parcels 16 April 2020 The Gauteng Department of Social Development (DSD) has been failing to meet its 48 hour turnaround time to deliver food parcels to residents in need during the national lockdown period. The Democratic Alliance (DA) has received numerous complaints from residents who are desperately in need of food and who claim that they have put in requests for food parcels and the department has yet to respond within the allocated time of 48 hours. DA Councillor, LesegoLekoto from Mogale City Local Municipality applied for food parcels for six families on 8 April and to date those families have not yet received food parcels from the department. This despite the fact that the Councillor received an acknowledgement receipt of his request via email with a reference number indicating that the turnaround time for food deliveries is seven working days. This is one of many requests where the Gauteng ANC-led administration is failing to fulfill its promise to poor families who are hungry for food. For these applicants, food parcels are the only way to provide for their families during this difficult time. This clearly indicates that the department does not have a proper plan in place to distribute food parcels on time as per their pronouncement. The DA calls on the Acting MEC for Social Development, Panyaza Lesufi to provide clarity on the turnaround time with regards to the distribution of food parcels as well as to fast-track the process of food parcel distribution to ensure that no family goes to bed with empty stomachs.
