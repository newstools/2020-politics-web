We send our condolences to their family and friends at this time. Recoveries: As of today, the Western Cape has switched to an automated reporting of recoveries, which does not depend on the manual recording of each patient’s recovery. The Western Cape has recorded 607 recoveries. Most residents who are infected by Covid-19 will recover, and we should remember to be kind, caring and compassionate to those who are ill. We must also remember that while most people do recover, those with comorbidities, as well as those of an older age, might face very serious complications. Each one of us has an important role to play to help protect these vulnerable groups and to save lives. Testing and screening: The Western Cape has identified clusters or “hotspots” and has acted swiftly to screen and test around these hotspots, which has resulted in a higher proportion of positive tests. This is done in line with our active case finding approach. This has allowed us to focus on the contacts associated with these cases and to ensure that every person who is infected with Covid-19 is contacted, and advised to isolate or quarantine. This is a critical part of our health department’s response, and essential for containing the virus. We thank the national department for their positive response to this practice and for the support the national Minister has offered. Witzenberg: One of the areas where we are taking this active case finding approach is in Witzenberg- where we have a total of 100 cases today.  We have been concentrating our screening and contact tracing efforts in this area since the first cluster of cases emerged to make sure that we identify every single person identified with Covid-19. Our Minister of Health Nomafrench Mbombo visited Ceres today and joined for the screening programme. Every resident of Witzenberg has an important role to play in helping us stop the spread. It is essential that you stay home. When you do leave the house to buy essential goods, you must keep your distance from all other people. Remember to stand 1.5 metres away from others and avoid going into any space where people have gathered. You should also always wear a cloth mask, and you must follow the 5 golden rules of hygiene at all times.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-leader-1','ezslot_4',118,'0','0'])); If you are not feeling well, you must stay home, and call the Coronavirus hotline for advice of what to do next. Witzenberg is a rural area with a large community of seasonal farm workers. While we understand that many may be making plans to return home at this time of year, we urge them not to. At this time, it is best that they stay in the Western Cape and avoid traveling to other provinces. We urge all residents in the area to take the opportunity to be screened during our screening process. Those who are symptomatic will be tested. Anyone feeling ill or experiencing flu-like symptoms is urged to stay at home, and call the national or provincial hotlines (0800 029 999 or 021 928 4102) or to call ahead to their clinic before arriving. Meeting with Eastern Cape Premier Today, Transport Minister Bonginkosi Madikizela, Western Cape Provincial Police Commissioner Yolisa Matakata and I held a meeting with the Eastern Cape Premier Oscar Mabuyane where we discussed issues around taxis travelling for funerals as well as the movement of seasonal agricultural workers between provinces. We must be sensitive to the fact that many Western Cape residents may want to return to the Eastern Cape for funerals and this is allowed under the regulations. However, we are aware that there are instances of criminality and the use of fraudulent or fake death certificates. Between us, we were able to map the way forward, which includes joint operations by both provinces, to ensure that we are able to respond to the needs of our residents, without putting either province at further risk of infection.
