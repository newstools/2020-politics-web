EFF statement on Chinaâ€™s treatment of African Nationals 12 April 2020 The Economic Freedom Fighters condemns the inhumane treatment the Chinese government is subjecting African Nationals to. According to the reports, Africans in Guangzhou city are targets of suspicion and subjected to forced evictions, arbitrary quarantining and mass coronavirus testing on the basis of being African. The racist motivated evictions on African Nationals in China has forced some to live under bridges, shops and restaurants owners turn Africans away from buying food from them. We condemn in the strongest possible terms the abuse and racist mistreatment of Africans living and working in China; particularly at a time when we should be supporting one another to recover from the Coronavirus pandemic. As the international community we must come together to fight the spread of Covid-19 instead of engaging in racial discrimination based on unfounded claims that Africans are spreading the virus. We call on the African Union (AU) and the Chairperson Of the AU Cyril Ramaphosa to ensure the safety and well-being of all Africans across the globe and the unconditional repatriation of all Africans from China.
