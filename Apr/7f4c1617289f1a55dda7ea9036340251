DA calls on government to modify regulations for informal traders during lockdown 16 April 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng is calling on government to rethink the current regulations regarding fresh produce informal traders, after a video surfaced showing Johannesburg Metro Police (JMPD) confiscating fresh produce from informal traders who were selling their produce outside Jabulani Mall, Soweto. Currently the regulations allow informal traders with permits to sell fresh produce in designated spaces or areas. Whilst this move to amend the original Disaster Management regulations was correct, the DA believes that it has done very little to assist informal traders. Informal traders depend on foot traffic for the bulk of their customers. The regulations to fight COVID-19, restricts the movement of people and therefore limits the available customer base for informal traders. As the DA in Gauteng we are calling for the relaxation of regulations to allow for informal traders who sell produce to be permitted to sell their produce in residential areas with trolleys. Furthermore, we are calling on supermarket chains to assist informal traders with trolleys and for the Gauteng Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (GDARD) to make Tuk- Tuks available as well. Should government consider this intervention, all informal traders who have permits to trade must at all times wear protective clothing and observe the one metre distancing rule. While we continue to look for innovative ways for people to be able to feed their families during this challenging time, we encourage South Africans to stay at home and observe the lockdown restrictions.
