These officers have been deployed in the Khayelitsha, Lenteqeur, Nyanga (including Bishop Lavis), Milnerton, Bellville, Wynberg, Delft, and Cape Town clusters. Additionally, they are supporting the COVID-19 response team and the StrandonteinSafeSpace established to protect homeless individuals during the outbreak.” “Over the course of the lockdown period, we have seen a staggering decline in crime and, in particular, alleged murder admissions or suspected murders. In the 14th week of 2020, there 31 suspected murders. Whilst this remains 31 deaths too many, this figure is considerably lower than the same period last year in which there were 105 suspected murders. In total, that marks a 70.5% decrease in suspected murders,” said Minister Fritz. Minister Fritz said, “I have requested that the Western Cape Liquor Authority (WCLA) ensure that any outlet which contravenes the lockdown conditions be liable for a maximum fine of R100 000 and have their license revoked immediately, subject to investigation. It has further been requested that the WCLA join the PROVJOINTS committee and be included in every case were liquor was sold or an arrest was made to better track the original point of sale. I further welcome the resolution taken by PROVJOINTS on 25 March that no alcohol will be returned to any outlet after paying admission of guilt.” eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','0']));Minister Fritz added, “All acts of abuse under the joint command of SAPS and SANDF will be investigated by the relevant entity responsible for these investigations. Residents are asked to report any complaints of policing inefficiency to the Western Cape Police Ombudsman. Additionally, cases of police and military brutality should be reported to the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) or to Military Ombudsman respectively.” Mayoral Committee Member for Safety and Security at the City of Cape Town, Alderman JP Smith said, “While we have seen a decline in crime, there is no shortage of work for our Law Enforcement officers who have shown time and time again, their dedication to creating a safer city for all. I am proud of the work our officers are doing to assist in the response to COVID-19 through their peace officer powers and other training. I encourage everyone to abide by the lockdown regulations and stay indoors.” Useful contact details Western Cape Police Ombudsman: Ombudsman@wcpo.gov.za or visit www.westerncape.gov.za/police-ombudsman Military Ombudsman: email intake@milombud.org or call 080 726 6283 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-banner-1','ezslot_3',116,'0','0']));Independent Police Investigative Directorate: email complaints@ipid.gov.za or visit www.ipid.gov.za South African Police Service: 08600 10111 or use the MySAPS app Emergency Services: 107 or use Vodacom’s Emergency Services App Inefficiencies related to Law Enforcement: RichardGavin.Bosman@capetown.gov.za Law Enforcement: 021 480 770 / 021 596 1999 Emergency Medical Service: 10177 or use Vodacom’s Emergency Services App For further clarity on the conditions of lockdown, please see the following FAQs: https://www.westerncape.gov.za/department-of-health/frequently-asked-questions-about-events-and-hospitality Please see English audio clip here: https://clyp.it/dajgfrm1 Issued by Cayla Ann Tomás Murray, Spokesperson for Minister Albert Fritz, 6 April 2020
