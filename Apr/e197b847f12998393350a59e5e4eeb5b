Law Society shocked and concerned on attempt on life of attorney specializing in criminal work 9 April 2020 The Law Society of South Africa (LSSA) is shocked at the attempt of criminal law attorney, William Booth’s life. Mr Booth was shot at while he was at his home this morning. Shots were fired while he was fortunately shielded by his wife’s car in the garage. Mr Booth is the chairperson of the LSSA’s Criminal Law Committee. He also serves on various structures in the legal profession. ‘The LSSA strongly condemns the attack. The attempt on the lives of legal practitioners undermines the rule of law and access to justice. Legal practitioners should be able to practise without fearing for their lives,’ says LSSA President MvuzoNotyesi. The LSSA urges the South African Police Service to leave no stone unturned in finding those responsible and bringing them to justice. The right to legal representation is enshrined in our Constitution and this cowardly attack is an attack on our democracy and affects all residents of South Africa.
