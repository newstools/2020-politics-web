Mossel Bay therefore currently stands at 17 cases. There are currently 29 Covid-19 positive people being treated in hospitals in the province, with 15 of these in intensive care. Community screening and testing:eval(ez_write_tag([[468,60],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_1',114,'0','0'])); Community screening and testing will resume in areas across the province tomorrow. We encourage those in communities where testing is occurring to make use of the opportunity. Screening and testing help us to identify pockets of infection, and allow our contact tracing teams to get to work quickly and work to stop the spread. Tomorrow’s testing will be conducted in the following areas: Cape Winelands: Mbekweni, Oliver Tambo Garden Route: Asla Park, Mzathi Street Blocks Metro: Bloekombos, Kraaifontein (ward 6), Delft, Bo-Kaap, Imizamo Yethu, Lotus River, Grassy Park, Gugulethu, Nyanga and Kleinvlei. Screening sites may change at short notice in order to respond to needs as they arise. Screening and testing is especially important in communities which are densely populated and in those with high numbers of vulnerable populations, such as the elderly, or people with underlying medical conditions. As a province, we have seen an uptick in the number of community transmissions, especially in the metro area. We therefore call on all of our residents to take precautions to keep themselves and their families safe. Residents are reminded that they should only leave their homes to purchase food, collect a social grant, go to the pharmacy, seek medical attention, or if they are employed to do an essential service. When leaving home for these activities, it is vital that people practice social distancing, including leaving sufficient space in queues, and in other places like taxi ranks and bus stops. Make sure you wash your hands frequently, avoid touching your face, and if you are able to, wear a clean, cloth mask. Cloth masks must always be used in conjunction with other hygiene methods and must be carefully put on and taken off, using only the ties or strings. They should be washed and ironed after every use. We also call on those businesses which are open at this time, to take hygiene seriously in order to protect their staff and their customers. Third Thursday: Due to the phenomenal public response to our First Thursday radio show, we will be hosting a Third Thursday show Question and Answer show between 6 and 7 pm this week. This will be an hour long show which will be facilitated at Bush Radio and simulcast across several stations across the province. Listeners will be able to call in on 021 448 6266, WhatsApp on 061 862 1065 or SMS keyword Covid-19 to 32158 followed by their question, name and area. Each SMS costs R1.00 *** Previous: Update by Premier Alan Winde on the coronavirus 12 April 2020eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-leader-1','ezslot_4',118,'0','0'])); As of 00h01 on 12 April, the Western Cape recorded 599 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection.

We also recorded the seventh death in the province yesterday- a 61-year old male. We extend our thoughts and condolences to his family and loved ones at this time. The Western Cape Government is working hard to stop the spread and to save lives. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-large-mobile-banner-1','ezslot_0',124,'0','0']));We are encouraged that the growth in the number of new cases in many of our non-metro areas has been minimal. This is however not a time to relax our effort. Now more than ever, we must stick to regular handwashing and social distancing protocols if and when we leave home. Everyone should be obeying the lockdown regulations so that we can stop the spread. We encourage the wearing of cloth masks for those going out in public, either to buy food, go to the pharmacy or seek medical care. We, however, remind residents that N95 respirators and surgical masks should be preserved for the frontline medical staff who require this protection. Cloth masks do not replace the golden rules of good hygiene practices- including regular handwashing and social distancing - which must still be adhered to. Cloth masks must be properly worn and removed. They must also be washed and ironed after every use in order to be most effective in stopping the spread. Avoid touching your mask while wearing it and never touch the inside of the mask. I would like to extend my gratitude to all of the essential employees who have worked throughout this long weekend. We thank the health care workers, emergency services, police and law enforcement officers, retail workers, agricultural sector workers, social workers, NGOs and all of the other people who sacrificed time at home or with their families over this weekend. We appreciate and value your service. Issued by Premier Alan Winde, 12 April 2020
