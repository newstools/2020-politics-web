Gauteng prioritises food security in fight against Coronavirus COVID-19 14 April 2020 The Gauteng Provincial Government and social partners are providing relief to the poor and vulnerable groups as the country battles the Covid-19 pandemic. Gauteng Premier, David Makhura, on Tuesday, 14 April 2020, visited food banks across the province to ensure there is enough supplies available for families in distress. Since the start of the lockdown the provincial government has worked with social partners to provide 15 000 food-insecure households with food. This number is being increased dramatically to ensure the indigent are provided with essentials beyond the lockdown. “Food security forms part of three-pillar strategy in the fight against the spread of COVID-19. Today we visited food banks across the province to ensure a fair process of food distribution. The system must be about reaching the 20% of Gauteng residents who are food insecure. There should be no patronage networks and no political interference in all processes,” said Premier Makhura.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0'])); Premier Makhura appealed to NGO’s, the business community, civil society and all those who continue to lend a helping hand  in the form of donations to contact the Gauteng Provincial Government on hotline@gauteng.gov.za Families in distress can contact the Gauteng Provincial Government on 0860 011 000 or email support@gauteng.gov.za. to access the social security relief programmes.
