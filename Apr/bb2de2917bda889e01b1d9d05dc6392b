Mayor Plato condemns lawlessness and looting 22 April 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));The South African Police Service (SAPS) and the City’s Metro Police and Law Enforcement are fully deployed and have already made a number of arrests. They will continue to arrest any person contravening the lockdown regulations. I am calling on our law-abiding residents to please immediately report any person who is involved in the increasing incidents of lawlessness and looting taking place in some of our communities. When it comes to emergency food provision, President Cyril Ramaphosa has made it clear that the national government is aware of the dire need being faced by many families and has put provisions in place to relieve some of the pressure, including the temporary increase in social grants. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));The National Department of Social Development through SASSA (South African Social Security Agency) remain the primary stakeholder when it comes to food distribution for those in need. Please contact SASSA on 0800 60 10 11 or 021 469 0235 for more information. In addition, there are a number of soup kitchens across the metro who are providing a warm meal to residents in need, and I have provided many of these with additional equipment and food items to serve more residents during this pandemic. Local businesses have come forward with generous donations for food parcels and we have worked with NGOs and local community leaders to distribute these parcels to those in need. If there are more businesses who would like to lend a helping hand, please contact my office and we will gladly facilitate any donations with local NGOs who are well-placed to distribute food to those in need. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));I have noted the fake news saying that ward councillors ‘must arrange food parcels’. This is not true, and the public must please check official sources before relying on fake news that is being spread on social media and Whatsapp. Who can public and shop owners contact if they witness looting?
