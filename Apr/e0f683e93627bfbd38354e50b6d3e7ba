Mineral Resources and Energy Committee Chair welcomes arrest of Implats Platinum CEO  17 April 2020eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0'])); The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Mineral Resources and Energy, Mr Sahlulele Luzipo, has welcomed the arrest of the Chief Executive Officer of Implats Platinum mine in Rustenburg, Mr Mark Munroe, who has since been granted bail of R60 000. The arrest took place after an appeal on Thursday morning made by Mr Luzipo, in which he called on law enforcement agencies to act decisively against mining executives who contravene the lockdown regulations. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));His call came before the Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy, Mr Gwede Mantashe, made an announcement relaxing some of the regulations regarding mining activity during the lockdown. Although Mr Luzipo understands that the merits of the alleged contravention will still be tested in a competent court of law, Mr Luzipo is not convinced that Mr Munroe acted of his own volition without the knowledge of the non-executive management. However, if the non-executive management did not give the go-ahead regarding the alleged contravention, they will then be expected to take further steps against Mr Munroe. Mr Luzipo further calls on the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy to investigate a possible abuse of permit by Mr Munroe in light of the allegations levelled against him. “We expect the department to conduct such an investigation and act decisively against perpetrators, with a view of sending a strong message to everyone that permits are to be used strictly for the intended purpose and any deviation will not be tolerated,” said Mr Luzipo.
