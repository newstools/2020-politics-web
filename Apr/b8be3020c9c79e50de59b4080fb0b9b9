DA calls on SASSA to provide public with urgent update on R350 Covid-19 unemployment grant 23 April 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) calls on the Department of Social Development (DSD) and the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) to urgently provide the public with clarity on the special Covid-19 Social Relief of Distress grant of R350. Since President Cyril Ramaphosa’s announcement on Tuesday, millions of South Africans are still in the dark about the full details of this grant. While we understand the enormous pressure and capacity constraints SASSA is currently working under, we must equally be alive to the desperation and need that is currently facing our communities. The DA calls on SASSA and the DSD to provide clarity on the following matters: The application process – will there be a dedicated phone number or email address for applicants to use? Will SASSA re-open and capacitate its offices to meet the influx in applications? What are the criteria for unemployed individuals to apply for the grant? How long will the application process take to finalise? What will the payment process look like? Will applicants need a bank account? Will funds be paid out in cash or in the form of food vouchers? The DA has received numerous requests from the public on how they can apply and access the special grant. It is, therefore, critical that SASSA utilizes its channels to provide the public will all the relevant information they need. The DA welcomes this much-needed relief for those who have lost their livelihoods due to the pandemic as it will go a long way in addressing the rise in hunger and food scarcity in the country. However, the public needs urgent clarification on what the application process will entail in order to ensure that those who desperately need this assistance will not wait any longer for relief.
