DA calls on Gauteng MEC for Finance to table new budget after the lockdown 1 April 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng is calling on the MEC for Finance, Nomuntu Nkomo-Ralehoko to table a new budget for the 2020/2021 financial year after the 21-day lockdown. While the lockdown is needed to help curb the spread of Covid-19 and flatten the curve, this is having a negative impact on the Gauteng economy. This is further compounded by the fact that Gauteng has a high rate of in-migration as well as a high unemployment rate which is putting additional pressure on the province’s financial resources. By tabling a new budget this will allow the Gauteng Provincial Government (GPG) to redirect funds to programmes within the various departments that will help to stimulate economic growth and create jobs particularly for our youth, women and people with disabilities. Furthermore, the DA is once again calling on the MEC for Finance and Premier David Makhura to look at consolidating, and where needed, do away with entities that are not contributing to the fiscus but instead are draining it with projects that to date have shown no success in terms of job creation and increasing revenue for the provincial government. The country finds itself it in a precarious position and cost and internal controls are critical, whilst maintenance rather than new infrastructure projects should be considered. Now is the time for Premier Makhura and MEC Nkomo-Ralehko to show bold leadership that will allow the right conditions to exist for our economy to recover from the impact of Covid-19. I will be tabling further questions in the Gauteng Provincial Legislature to ascertain what contingency plans are place to sustain the current budget priorities for the new financial year which begins today; how this will be managed over the medium term and if the GPG will be lobbying the private sector for support to help grow the local economy.
