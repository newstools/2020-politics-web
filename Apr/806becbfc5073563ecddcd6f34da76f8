Minister Ndabeni-Abrahams owes South Africans an apology 7 April 2020 The IFP calls on Communications and Digital Technologies Minister, Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams to apologise to South Africans for a grandiose display of flouting governments lockdown regulations. This is not a time for double-standards and for “displays” of leadership in adhering to lockdown regulations. The global Covid-19 pandemic requires true, genuine and honest leadership in which unites all of us to obey the law and to slow down the transmission of the novel coronavirus. Ministers are not above the law and the regulations. “luncheons” and gatherings at friends or family are in contravention of the gazetted regulations of the lockdown. Minister Ndabeni-Abrahams, Cabinet and all other members of the Executive, must walk their talk in ensuring that what they say to South Africans is consistent with what they do. We welcome President Cyril Ramaphosa’s swift intervention in reprimanding Minister Ndabeni-Abrahams and will monitor the outcome of their meeting. President Cyril Ramaphosa should request that Minister Ndabeni-Abrahams apologises and commits to the regulations. Many South Africans are subjected to uncomfortable circumstances and heightened anxiety and therefore should be comforted that government and the global community are committed and all in this fight against the spread of Covid-19 together. The IFP reiterates our call to South Africans to remain at home during this time.
