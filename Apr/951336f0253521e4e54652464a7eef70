Lockdown violations continue 28 April 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));'It is clear by the number of people who continue to flout the lockdown rules and who are fined for traffic violations, they have little regard for the law. The lockdown impacts everyone and it is there to ensure the safety of all our residents. It is unfortunate so many are willing to put their own lives, and that of their loved ones, at risk. Even copper cable thieves are not deterred by the lockdown. Our enforcement staff will continue to clamp down on errant residents and drivers,' said the City of Cape Town's Mayoral Committee Member for Safety and Security, Alderman JP Smith. Metro Police officers were busy with lockdown patrols at Govan Mbeki Road in Khayelitsha on Thursday 23 April, when they noticed two men digging up copper cables. The two, aged 25 and 35, were arrested for theft and 1,2 meters of copper cable and a spade were confiscated. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));During crime prevention patrols Metro Police officers netted 19 suspects for a range of offences from contravention of the Disaster Management Act and the illegal possession of drugs, to the illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition, domestic violence, theft, and the possession of a stolen vehicle. They also issued 933 fines for by-law and traffic contraventions. On Saturday 25 April, officers arrested a 34-year-old suspect for the possession of one packet of tik and a half Mandrax tablet in Ocean View. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));During a joint roadblock with other role players officers attached to the K9 Unit pulled over a vehicle which was found to have been stolen. The 32-year-old driver was arrested and taken to Harare police station. On Friday 24 April an operator at the Metro Police CCTV surveillance cameras in the Cape Town CBD noticed a man exchanging what was suspected to be drugs. Law enforcement was dispatched and he was found in possession of 5 packets heroin. He was arrested and taken to Cape Town Central police station. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','0']));The City's Traffic Service also had a busy time as officers arrested six suspects, impounded their vehicles and issued 5 052 fines. This is in addition to 1 941 lockdown fines that were issued. 'Our officers spend a lot of time issuing fines to residents who violate the lockdown regulations and other by-laws. With so many competing demands at this unprecedented time in our country’s history, it is selfish to put yourself and others at risk. We will continue to ramp up efforts to keep communities safe,' added Alderman Smith. Issued by Media Office, City of Cape Town, 28 April 2020
