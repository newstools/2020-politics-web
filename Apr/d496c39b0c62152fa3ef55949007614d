Food parcels stolen at Greenfields in Ekurhuleni 26 April 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng has learnt that food parcels meant for the poor during this critical national lockdown was stolen at the Smart Angels Crèche in Greenfields Ward 8, Ekurhuleni. It is alleged that a truck delivered the food parcels on Thursday evening to crèche for the Greenfields residents in Ward 8. The food parcels were to be distributed to the residents the next day and were allegedly stolen from the crèche premises overnight. The residents who were meant to receive the food parcels were angry and frustrated about having to go back home empty handed after receiving the sad news that the food parcels have been stolen. Food parcels have now become a target for criminals. We will closely monitor this case to ensure that no stone is left unturned and that those implicated are arrested and face the full might of the law. The DA is calling on Acting Gauteng MEC for Social Development, Panyaza Lesufi to urgently investigate this incident and ensure that places where food parcels are to be kept are safe and have tight security. The MEC should also make other means available to ensure that these residents receive their food parcels as they are desperately in need of food.
