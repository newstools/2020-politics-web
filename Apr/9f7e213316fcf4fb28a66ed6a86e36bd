Contribution to the Solidarity Fund 11 April 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));The threat of the Covid-19 pandemic has necessitated drastic measures in the form of the National Lockdown to slow down the rate of transmissions and to flatten the curve. The lockdown, whilst a being a necessary intervention in a time of crisis, has adversely affected South Africa’s already struggling economy. The road to recovery will most definitely be a difficult one which will require patriotic cooperation, collaborative action and policy certainty. Accordingly, the IFP National Executive Committee (NEC) in a teleconference meeting yesterday unanimously agreed that the IFP will make a contribution of half a million rand (R500 000) to the Solidarity Fund over three months. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));This contribution will be sourced from IFP Public Representatives through the Office of the IFP Treasurer-General. The IFP stands in solidarity with South Africans during this time, and we hope our contribution to the Solidarity Fund will make a meaningful difference. When Parliament rose for recess at the end of 2019 IFP President Emeritus Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi MP said the following “…let us remember not only our own needs, but the needs of those around us. May no one in our communities be lonely or without food. May no one weep or sigh. Whatever we are able to do, for anyone, let us do it.” eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));May this spirit of Ubuntu/Botho and solidarity of purpose be the wind under our wings as a Nations during this time. Our demonstrations of solidarity need not be monetary but through our small and personal efforts we can all help each other as South Africans. We reiterate our call to South Africans to adhere to the rules and regulations of the lockdown. eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','0']));#StayAtHome to save lives, starting with yours.
