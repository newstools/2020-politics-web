DA lays charges against the KZN Premier for breaching lockdown regulations 27 April 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));Today the Democratic Alliance (DA) laid charges against the KZN Premier Sihle Zikalala based on the current Stage 5 lockdown regulations announced by the President on the 25th of March 2020. This follows today’s events where the Premier called essential workers to a mini-rally at Clairwood Hospital. The gazetted regulation on the restrictions of movement, section 11 B (ii) stipulates that “every gathering, as defined in regulation 1 is prohibited, except for funeral as provided for in subregulation(8)”. Astonishingly, just yesterday the Premier was announcing that eThekwini remains the epicentre of the Coronavirus in the province yet the same person calls for a mini-rally. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));EThekwini has 67% of  KZN cases of the virus and the numbers keep increasing by approximately 10 cases daily. The KwaZulu-Natal province carries the highest number of infected health workers in SA at 122 (15% of all infected) but today we saw the Premier of the province calling those same essential workers to a rally. He pulled essential workers from vital duties in wards and ambulances. We were shocked when my colleague Gavin Hegter and I were initially refused the right to open a case. The officer informed us that his superiors had told him there was no case because during the rally there was social distancing. We eventually opened the case because the laws of this country were broken. There are many more substantial ways the province could have shown their appreciation to essential workers like more PPE, safer working conditions or employing more staff. A better way of spending vital government budget, instead of a stage and sound system. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));The Premier was not practising what he has been preaching. Even the State President delivered addressing away from the public, yet the KZN Premier’s Facebook page was explicit about today’s event as a Freedom Day celebration, putting at risk the already vulnerable health workers. Everyone is equal under the law and serious action must be taken against the Premier of KwaZulu-Natal. Issued by Dianne Kohler Barnard, Durban Central Constituency Head, 27 April 2020
