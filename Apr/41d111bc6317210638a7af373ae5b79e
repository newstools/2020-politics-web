AfriForum wants to approach court over racial discrimination against tourism enterprises regarding COVID-19 relief 7 April 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));The civil rights organisation AfriForum today placed the Minister as well as the Department of Tourism on terms following the Department’s announcement that relief would be provided to small, micro- and medium-sized enterprises (SMME’s) in line with the Department’s policy of black economic empowerment (BEE) and economic transformation. Tourism enterprises have until 30 May 2020 to apply for financial relief from the Department’s COVID-19 emergency fund. AfriForum intends to bring an application for review against the Minister and the Department should the Department not abandon its intent to continue with these discriminating provisions within seven days. This follows after AfriForum sent a letter of demand to MmamolokoKubayi-Ngubane, Minister of Tourism, on 25 March 2020 demanding that proposed provisions for relief for tourism enterprises based on race, age, disability and gender be removed. According to Kallie Kriel, CEO of AfriForum, it should not matter who the owner of an enterprise is when determining which enterprises require aid. “In these times of crisis everyone should stand together against our mutual enemy – COVID-19. It is tragic and immoral that the government is continuing to promote its race-based agenda. There is a big difference between BEE measures and support during this crisis.”eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0'])); AfriForum encourages tourism enterprises to still apply for relief at www.tourism.gov.za/Pages/COVID19TOURISMRELIEFFUND.aspx. You can SMS the name of your enterprise to 45113 (R1) to provide AfriForum with your enterprise’s details so that we can implement legal action on your behalf should your application be rejected based on BEE requirements. You can also send an email with your enterprise’s details to afriforum@afriforum.co.za. Issued by Hesti Steenkamp, Media Relations Officer, AfriForum, 7 April 2020
