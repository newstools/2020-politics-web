Community screening starts todayeval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_3',115,'0','0'])); In my update yesterday, I announced that the Western Cape Department of Health has identified seven areas where community screening will be conducted. I can confirm that in fact community screening has already begun today in Happy Valley and Ilitha Park. Credit must be given to the teams at the Department of Health who are implementing this programme so quickly. Community screening is still scheduled to commence in the following Cape Town Metro sub-districts, and in some areas, we’ve already begun loud hailing operations to make the communities aware: Khayelitsha: Town2 (Monday) eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-banner-1','ezslot_4',116,'0','0']));Western: Bo-Kaap (Tuesday) Tygerberg: Bishop Lavis (Monday) Klipfontein: Philippi (Monday) And, in the non-rural districts: Kwanonqaba, Mossel Bay (Monday) Mbekweni, Cape Winelands (Monday) A reminder that our community healthcare workers will be identifiable by their uniforms and ID cards, and members of the public are advised to request the person's credentials as part of rigorous safety precautions. We urge community members to welcome the Community Health Workers and to co-operate with them. President’s Coordinating Council (PCC) I participated in the President’s Coordinating Council today. I used the opportunity to commit the Western Cape Government to our country’s number one priority: to stop the spread of the Coronavirus and save lives. During my presentation, I also used the opportunity to raise concerns regarding incidents of police brutality. These incidents must be condemned, and we urge all those with complaints to please report these to IPID as soon as possible. On the discussion on regulations, I requested a common-sense approach that would allow, for example, equipment needed for e-learning for students to be purchased during the lockdown. Ensuring that learning continues for our children is a top priority of the Western Cape Government. We have officially sent a list of issues that would require clarification to Minister Dlamini-Zuma, and we are looking forward to further discussions so that clarity can be provided. First repatriation flight for foreign nationals Thanks to the considerable efforts of the Provincial Joint Operations Centre (JOC), the first repatriation flight for foreign nationals departed from Cape Town International Airport yesterday (03 April 2020) afternoon. This first flight saw 277 citizens from Germany, who were unable to leave before the lockdown, depart for Frankfurt.  A second flight to Munich will be departing today. We are incredibly grateful to all those in provincial and national government who assisted, as well as the teams at Cape Town stadium, Airports Company South Africa (ACSA), Cape Town International Airport (CTIA), the German Consulate in Cape Town and the South African Police Service (SAPS) whose involvement ensured the success of this repatriation project.

A message from the Western Cape Minister of Health Western Cape Health Minister, Nomafrench Mbombo said: "With cases of Covid-19 spreading throughout the province, doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers are on the frontlines of the pandemic as they care for these patients in our hospitals. The best way we can thank them is by staying home. “Our medical students are also pitching in to provide Coronavirus education on the phone. They are facing enormous challenges, yet they are responding with courage, resolve and professionalism.  Their dedication is a true inspiration. “Today, I would like to thank our EMS staff, physicians, nurses, community health workers and all healthcare workers and support staff who are caring for the most vulnerable among us.” Issued by Western Cape government, 5 April 2020
