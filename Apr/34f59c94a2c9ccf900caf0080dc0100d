It is alleged that the police stopped the young man who was on his way back from the shop to ask him what he was doing on the streets. He then explained to them about purchasing the electricity voucher. It is alleged that the police then pulled a gun and shot him when he was leaving them. The DA subsequently reported this barbaric incident to the IPID in KZN to investigate the matter. We were pleased that within half an hour, the IPID was already investigating the matter, giving it the urgency it deserves eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));Members of the DA leadership visited the family yesterday and checked on the state of the young man. We will continue offering our support to the family during this difficult time. It is shocking that during this challenging time of lockdown, where we are looking at our law enforcers to protect us, they are in fact the implicated perpetrators. The long arm of the law must take its course on the police officer who allegedly pulled a trigger causing harm to an innocent person who was out to provide for his family. Our laws allow citizens to leave the house if there is an urgent need, this was one of them and the young man did not deserve to be attacked and shot. We are really appalled by this behaviour and we hope the wrongdoers are arrested soon. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));This is not the time for victimising and attacking people. Instead, it is time for all of us the community and the law enforcers to unite in fighting the disease. Issued byZwakele Mncwango, DA KZN Leader, 21 April 2020
