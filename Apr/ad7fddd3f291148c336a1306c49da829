A humanitarian crisis is looming and we are not prepared 19 April 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));Recent reports of escalating looting of grocery stores throughout South Africa is pointing to a looming crisis in food security for the most vulnerable in our country. Millions of South African households depend on income from informal work, and this work has ceased under the Covid-19 lockdown regulations. Without this income, many households are facing the stark reality of starvation in the confines of their homes or shacks. In an effort to prevent deaths related to Covid-19, we have placed vulnerable households at risk of starvation and malnutrition. It should be clearly understood that people suffering from malnutrition and starvation will be more vulnerable to the symptoms of Covid-19. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));In recent days we have seen a rise in reports of arrests for non-compliance with the lockdown regulations, and looting of stores, driven by the desperation of those facing starvation. The reality is that the regulations governing our lockdown are forcing many South Africans to choose between starvation or breaking the law. Anyone under these circumstances would do what is necessary to feed their family. The challenge that arises from this situation, is the likelihood that we face potential widespread breaches of the regulations governing the lockdown, where the vulnerable in our society will face the brutality of law enforcement and the SANDF. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2',114,'0','0']));I will be writing to President Ramaphosa and making the following proposals: The reconsideration of our regulations that continue to safeguard both the health of our citizens, and their ability to earn a basic household income. An expansive rollout of a food security programme that will ensure those unable to earn a basic living, do not face the stark reality of starvation. eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_3',115,'0','0']));Directives to law enforcement agencies and the SANDF to exercise restraint in their enforcement of the regulations of this lockdown. Without these steps being taken with urgency, South Africa is likely to see a combination of lockdown breaches, starvation and brutality meted out to the most vulnerable in our society. This is a humanitarian crisis we cannot afford. Issued by Herman Mashaba, Founder, The Peopleâ€™s Dialogue, 19 April 2020
