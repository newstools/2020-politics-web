Further to her apology, we are pleased with the stern action taken against her by President Cyril Ramaphosa in placing her on two months of special leave - of which one month will be without pay. We welcome law enforcement in ensuring that absolute compliance to the lockdown regulations is observed and that Minister Ndabeni-Abrahams is subjected to penalty because she is not above the law. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));Minister Ndabeni-Abrahamsâ€™ regrettable and irresponsible actions during the lockdown which will now be met with harsh penalty, may serve as a lesson to all South Africans that no citizen should break the gazetted rules of the lockdown and that law enforcement will take its course.
