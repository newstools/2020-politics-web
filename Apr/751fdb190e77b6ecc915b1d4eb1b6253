Statement of unconditional apology by Councillor Nkosinjane Speelman, Mayor of Matjhabeng Municipality 8 April 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));Yesterday I made a video-recorded apology for the derogatory remarks that I have made about the colored community in Bronville. After further reflection I realized that this apology was woefully inadequate, in that there is no way that I can, or should, try to justify my behavior in any way whatsoever. The only appropriate, and acceptable, apology is an unconditional one. I apologize unconditionally to the colored community of Bronville, and the whole colored community of South Africa. This apology is also humbly presented to our whole South African nation with specific reference to all our national groups, and specifically to my political party, and beloved Liberation Movement, the African National Congress (ANC). eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));I am deeply embarrassed for the shame and harm that my utterly unacceptable remarks have caused. Those deplorable utterances in no way whatsoever reflect the non-racial struggle for a just and inclusive South Africa that we as members of the ANC so proudly fought for. As the media statement by the ANC Free State Province so correctly state: “Thestruggle for freedom was fought by all oppressed people of South Africa including Indian and Colored communities, who played a critical role in rejecting apartheid and its institutions and fought side-by-side with all as part of the progressive forces towards achieving a non-racial, non-sexist, prosperous and democratic society.” I have been summoned by the ANC Free State Provincial Executive Committee, to whom I will give a full account, and in person also present an unconditional apology. As a disciplined cadre of the ANC, I will subject myself to the wishes and discipline of my organization. It is my ardent wish to do everything possible, and expected from me, to address, and correct, the terrible mistake that I have made.
