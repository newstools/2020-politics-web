Just today, the Unemployment Insurance Fund has disbursed R92-million, which brings the total paid to date from April 16 to just under R1.8-billion. These payments cover up to 790 150 workers. In some cases, the claims have been paid within 24-hours of presentation. This is over and above the payments the Fund has been paying for ordinary benefits – pregnancy, retrenchments and other benefits – which have amounted to R804-million since the beginning of April. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));“As enjoined by the President, we continue making sure we ease the load of lockdown.
