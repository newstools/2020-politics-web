We appreciate the gravity of the situation and the selflessness and patriotism that has been displayed by the essential services providers, in particular the members of SANDF who will be traveling to the different destinations. We hope that the government has put in place adequate measures to ensure that those who are repatriated will be put under compulsory quarantine before they can be released to their families. For those who will have contracted the virus, we urge the government to act swiftly and give the necessary attention to these citizens and prevent the spread of the virus. Let us all continue to observe the lockdown regulations, by staying home. By so doing we shall surely overcome COVID-19.
