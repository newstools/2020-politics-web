They include a 76 year old woman, a 44 year old woman and a 31 year old man- all with significant comorbidities. We send our condolences to their families and loved ones at this time. Rigorous screening and testing: I understand that our residents are worried as they see the number of new laboratory confirmed Covid-19 cases grow rapidly in the Western Cape, but this is a natural result of our more rigorous testing approach. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','0'])); Our strategy is to do screening and testing even more rigorously. This is the best way to contain the virus and to flatten the curve. We are going to face a very challenging time in the weeks and months to come. The lockdown has helped, but it has not stopped the virus. The peak is still to come, and many people will be infected by Covid-19. That is why it is so important that every single one of us continue to play our part to flatten the curve. If we do this, we can prevent our health system from being overwhelmed, and we can save many lives. A total of 150 847 people have been screened in the province this month- with 6006 sent for testing. Our increased focus on screening and testing has helped us to respond to areas of risk as we identify them, and then quarantine or isolate people where necessary, as part of our prevention strategy.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-banner-1','ezslot_5',116,'0','0'])); Municipal assistance: Today, we can announce that R16.2 million in additional funding has been allocated to municipalities in the province towards humanitarian relief. Our district and local municipalities are closest to the ground, and on a day to day basis, are delivering services to residents. They therefore have a good sense of where needs are greatest and this additional funding will help them to address some of the most immediate needs. Minister of Local Government, and Environmental Affairs, Anton Bredell said: “The Provincial Department of Local Government has allocated additional funding of R16.2 million to various municipalities in the Western Cape with a focus on those municipalities most at need. The R16.2 million has been reallocated from existing budgets and is going to support municipalities in the Western Cape with humanitarian relief for the COVID-19 pandemic. “Municipalities are already providing much needed relief in various forms, including soup kitchens, homeless shelters and food parcels. This allocation will assist them in continuing to do so. The funds have been transferred directly to the municipal accounts,” Minister Bredell said.
