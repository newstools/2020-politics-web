Agriculture, Land Reform & Rural Development Committee welcomes the Covid-19 Agricultural Disaster Support Fund 6 April 2020 The Portfolio Committee on Agriculture, Land and Rural Development today welcomes the announcement by the Minister of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development, Ms Thoko Didiza, of the Covid-19 Agricultural Disaster Support Fund for Smallholder and Communal Farmers. Farm owners and farmworkers are among the most vulnerable people amidst the Covid-19 pandemic, as they have to work the land for the production of our food. In ensuring food security for the people of South Africa, the Portfolio Committee on Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development applauds the Minister for making this fund available. As the recent drought has affected many farmers, many of whom are in debt due to loans taken to continue farming, the department needs to work differently during this lock-down. The department must ensure that this assistance goes to farmers who need it most, mainly distressed small-scale and communal farmers. As some farmers are without electricity or internet connection, the department should not rely on them accessing the departmental website to download the application forms. The committee calls on the department to ensure that it reaches those farmers who fit the criteria from their database by other means other than online application. Committee Chairperson Nkosi Zwelivelile Mandela said: “The Department must prioritise women, youth and people with disabilities, and also relook at smallholder farmers with an annual turnover between R50 000 and R1 million, specifically look at lowering the minimum turnover”, for small-scale and communal farmers.
