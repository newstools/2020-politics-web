AfriForum did file court papers; Tourism Minister spreading fake news 15 April 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0']));AfriForum expressed its disappointment over the fact that Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane, the Minister of Tourism, is spreading fake news by falsely claiming that AfriForum did not file court papers yesterday to oppose her and her Department’s use of race as a benchmark in COVID-19 relief programmes. AfriForum has indeed started the legal process and a stamped notice of the motion is attached to this media statement as proof thereof. According to Kallie Kriel, CEO of AfriForum, the Minister is either spiteful or there is a serious lack of communication between her and the state attorney to whom the case number of AfriForum’s lawsuit was sent. “In light thereof that the Minister and her Department’s abuse of the COVID-19 crisis to further the ANC’s racial agenda is unjustifiable, it is not surprising that she is now turning to false technical arguments. The Minister is also setting a bad example by making herself guilty of spreading fake news in this time of crisis when fake news about COVID-19 has been prohibited.” AfriForum encourages all tourism enterprises to still apply for relief at www.tourism.gov.za/Pages/COVID19TOURISMRELIEFFUND.aspx. You can SMS the name of your enterprise to 45113 (R1) to provide AfriForum with your enterprise’s details so that we can implement legal action on your behalf should your application be rejected based on BEE requirements. You can also send an email with your enterprise’s details to afriforum@afriforum.co.za. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','1']));Read AfriForum’s media statement about the court case here.
