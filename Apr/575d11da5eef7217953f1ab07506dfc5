The Minister of Local Government, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning, Anton Bredell, said: “The national lockdown happened with short notice leaving many foreign passengers stranded and unable to return home. Multiple agencies overseen by the national government jumped in and worked to make the arrangements needed to help our visitors get home. Only foreign nationals who made the necessary arrangements with their consulates or embassies were allowed to leave the country.” The provincial repatriation effort was co-ordinated by the Provincial Disaster Management Centre along with several other partners, including the Department of Economic Development and Tourism, and Wesgro. The Minister of Finance and Economic Opportunities, David Maynier, said: "As many of these foreign nationals were tourists visiting the Western Cape ahead of the lockdown, it was important that they had a good experience despite the lockdown, so that when we are ready to open our borders again they will consider coming back and enjoying the best that Cape Town and the Western Cape has to offer. So, our tourism sector teams from the Department of Economic Development and Tourism, and Wesgro played an integral role in the repatriation, making sure our visitors were well taken care of. They even ensured that each visitor was given a farewell note wishing them a safe and speedy trip home, and welcoming them back when they are ready to return. It's these little touches that have always made Cape Town and the Western Cape a great place to visit, and I'd like to thank all involved in these successful repatriation efforts.” German Consul General, Matthias Hansen said: "When lockdown came, there were still almost 4.000 German tourists in the Western Cape. By Thursday, we will have repatriated all of them, plus another 400 from other EU countries. It has been a complex operation run by the Consulate and Embassy as a team, comprising 14 flights from Cape Town since 3 April, preceded by thorough preparation of people's movement under lockdown. At the same time, it has truly been a joint effort involving a tremendous measure of commitment on the part of our South African partners: the Western Cape Government, the City of Cape Town, Wesgro, National Government with Port Health and SAPS, South African Airways, ACSA and Cape Town Stadium. Without their invaluable contribution, we would not have come as far as we are today."
