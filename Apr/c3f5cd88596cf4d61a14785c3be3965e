WHO funding: SA government must intercede with U.S. Government 16 April 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));The IFP urges President Cyril Ramaphosa to use all diplomatic channels to intercede with the United States Government following a decision by President Donald Trump to withhold millions of dollars in funding to the World Health Organisation (WHO). President Ramaphosa must act in his capacity as Head of State and as Chairperson of the African Union. It is unfortunate that at this time in fighting the global Covid-19 pandemic funding for a global health entity is being withheld to the detriment of millions of poorer nations with weaker health systems. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));This is a time when the world requires strong leadership to encourage greater international cooperation and to set aside concerns or grievances in an effort to stop the chain of transmission of Covid-19 the world over. The WHO is active in coordinating a global response to infectious and communicable disease outbreaks; however, as regards Covid-19 is concerned, it has particularly been an asset in assisting African nations with managing the spread of the coronavirus. The WHO as an agency is indeed lumbered with a cumbersome organogram which has resulted in a very complex, bureaucratic and at times ineffective management. It is our view, that these issues and others raised by the U.S government may be valid, but that our response to the Covid-19 pandemic requires us all to set aside our need for reform of the agency over our need to save lives.
