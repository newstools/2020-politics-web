Attempts by motorists to cross Provincial boundaries despite a ban on inter-provincial travel increased from 125 on Monday to 196 on Wednesday.  Earlier in the week Gauteng had the highest number of motorists attempting to cross Provincial boundaries to other Provinces at 108, but has since been overtaken by Mpumalanga at 149 on Wednesday, 8 April. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2',114,'0','0']));This conduct demonstrate a worrying trend which must be roundly condemned by both government and civil society.  Those who undermine efforts to arrest the spread of this pandemic must face the full might of the law and equally face condemnation by society, as their behaviour places the lives of millions at risk. Despite this, Minister Mbalula encourages the majority of our citizens who continue to respect and comply with the lockdown regulations and directions to continue to do so and encourage others to follow suit Minister Fikile Mbalula further commends the sterling commitment of our traffic law enforcement officers across the country in ensuring that South Africans stay home and further provide critical support to other law enforcement authorities. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_3',115,'0','0']));The department through its entity, provincial departments responsible for road safety and municipalities deployed a total traffic officers across the country, to ensure compliance with the published Regulations and Directions. Minister Mbalula is motivated by the taxi associations, e-hailing providers and private motorists who continue to comply with the regulations and directives.  Industry bodies must play their part to reign in those who continue to demonstrate flagrant disregard of the law. Law enforcement will be intensified and authorities will not hesitate to ensure that the full might of the law is brought to bear on those who continue to break it.
