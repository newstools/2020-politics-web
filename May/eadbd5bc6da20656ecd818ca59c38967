DA welcomes Dudu Myeni delinquency ruling 27 May 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[468,60],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0']));The Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomes the High Court ruling declaring former SAA Board Chairperson, Dudu Myeni, a delinquent director in terms of Section 162 of the Companies Act. During her turbulent tenure at the national carrier, Myeni proved that she was clearly unfit, incompetent, and wholly incapable of holding any directorship position. The DA has long held the view that Myeni played a major role in bringing SAA to its knees and to its subsequent bankruptcy. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));Despite the myriad of allegations stacked against her, Myeni was given a soft exit from SAA without any consequences for the malfeasance that took place under her watch. We are therefore pleased that this court order will ensure that Myeni will never be deployed to any SOE or public business as a director by the ANC as a loyal cadre. Furthermore, the DA trusts that this judgment will ensure some sort of accountability for Myeni. We have noted that Judge Ronel Tomay has requested that the judgment and the evidence in this matter be referred to the NPA for their consideration and determination of whether an investigation regarding possible criminal conduct should follow. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));We urge the NPA to take up this matter urgently in order to ensure that Myeni finally has her day in Court.
