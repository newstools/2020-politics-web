DA calls for swift action by KZN Commissioner following alleged theft by Vryheid SAPS officers 4 May 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));The Democratic Alliance (DA) has written to KwaZulu-Natal Police Commissioner, General KhombinkosiJula, (view here) to call for his urgent intervention after a video clip (view here) of three SAPS officers allegedly stealing cash from a store went viral. The incident is believed to have taken place on 14 April. While it was originally identified as having taken place in Soweto, the DA can today confirm that it took place in Vryheid. A case was subsequently opened at the Vryheid Police Station. (CAS _ 605/04/2020). Despite the damning evidence against them, the DA has been informed that the three suspects are still at work, with no internal disciplinary hearings or arrests having taken place to date.  It is for this reason that we have written to General Jula. It is vital that he act promptly to ensure that the necessary disciplinary hearings are fast-tracked. This action must include the immediate suspension of the three officers pending the outcome of a full investigation. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));The DA is also aware that the store owner is afraid to come forward for fear of intimidation and General Jula needs to act swiftly to ensure the protection of this individual during the court process.  Finally, he also needs to make a public statement on the issue, outlining the steps that SAPS will take against the three officers concerned. It is precisely due to shocking and brazen incidents such as this that communities lose faith in the police.  SAPS officers are not exempt from the law and when officers do act illegally, they must face the full might of the law. It is unfortunate that all the good work done by SAPS officers is destroyed when some decide to be a law unto themselves. It is therefore vital that urgent action is taken to restore community confidence. The DA sincerely hopes that General Jula will treat this matter with the seriousness it deserves. We will continue to follow this process closely to ensure that justice is served. If found guilty, the officers concerned must be placed behind bars.
