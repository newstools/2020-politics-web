The scientific reason for the Lockdown, and which has been made clear by experts, was to buy us time to prepare for the peak that will inevitably come. The virus cannot be stopped and will continue to spread throughout the country. We have been working around the clock to make sure that we are prepared and that every resident that requires healthcare gets it when they need it. This has included: For more information on what we have done across government departments, visit the following link: https://coronavirus.westerncape.gov.za/news/western-cape-has-prepared-its-healthcare-system-peak-and-must-move-level-3-conjunction-targetedeval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','0'])); This is precisely why, that given our robust healthcare system preparation and that we will continue to rigorously intervene in hotspots, we must open more of our economy over time. Not allowing this to happen will threaten lives in the future as an unpreceded humanitarian crisis unfolds, and this cannot be ignored by any level of government. I want to again reiterate that this cannot be done alone. We need the help of every single person in our team effort to slow the spread, and “flatten the curve”. When you keep yourself safe, through practicing good hygiene, keeping your distance, and wearing a mask properly, you help keep vulnerable people who are at higher risk safe too. Your actions can save lives, and we need every person to continue to be our partner in this Covid-19 response. Issued by the Office of the Western Cape Premier, 19 May 2020
