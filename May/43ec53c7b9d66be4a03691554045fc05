DA calls for an immediate suspension of officers who abused a child 12 May 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));The Democratic Alliance (DA) in iLembe has written to KwaDukuza Municipal Manager Nhlanhla Mdakane calling for an immediate suspension pending an investigation of the two officers who were caught on a video that went viral on social media, which shows a child being tugged between two ‘peace officers’ of the KwaDukuza Municipality. The child was devastated by the incident and could suffer further emotional trauma. It further shows a scuffle between an adult male who was allegedly arrested. Community members took to social media venting on how the arrest was made in the presence of a distressed child. No matter what the context of the incident or what led up to this situation, it is simply unacceptable for municipal officers to behave in this manner. The DA has been consistently raising the issue of training, or lack thereof, of law enforcement officers with regards to their mandate. It seems that proper training on law enforcement and arrests are not taken seriously in this municipality. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));The DA calls for the immediate suspension pending the outcome of an investigation. No person is above the law, including law enforcement officers. We will ensure that this matter is treated with the urgency it deserves to ensure that no one else has their rights infringed on by officers who lack knowledge of the law. A National State of Disaster does not mean that the rights of citizens and especially vulnerable groups such as children are ignored and abused as we have seen in this incident. This thuggish behaviour is unacceptable and has no place whatsoever in a democracy. It is sadly however becoming more and more common as unreasonable lockdown restrictions persist which leaves citizens at the mercy of law enforcement officials. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));The DA will closely monitor this situation to ensure that the officers are held to account if found guilty.
