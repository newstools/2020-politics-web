Minister of Tourism spreading lies – ConCourt has not delivered judgement in AfriForum’s application for appeal 16 May 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));AfriForum has accused Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane, the Minister of Tourism, of spreading lies and fake news by announcing in a media statement that the Constitutional Court has dismissed AfriForum’s application for appeal. According to Kallie Kriel, CEO of AfriForum, AfriForum is not mentioned as an applicant in the judgement in the Solidarity case to which Kubayi-Ngubane refers and judgement has also not been directed to AfriForum’s legal team. “On top of this lie, the Minister also falsely pretends that the ConCourt’s ruling in Solidarity’s case confirms that there is no merit to AfriForum and Solidarity’s cases, while the ConCourt simply indicated that it will not at this stage consider Solidarity’s application. No ruling was made on the merits of the case,” Kriel added. “If a Minister such as Kubayi-Ngubane is prepared to discriminate on the basis of race even in this time of crisis against people who are fighting for survival, it is probably not surprising that she is prepared to spread lies without batting an eye,” Kriel said.
