MEC Albert Fritz calls on SAPS to act within the law 7 May 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));The Minister of Community Safety, Albert Fritz, calls on the South African Police Service (SAPS) to act within the law at all times. Minister Fritz has condemned incidents where SAPS and SANDF officials abused their power and used excessive force when it was not necessary or requited to enforce the law. During yesterday’s Ad-hoc committee on COVID-19, IPID’s Western Cape office presented figures on its number of cases to the provincial legislature. Of its 163 cases, 83 were directly linked to lockdown operations. Complaints include the discharge of a firearm, rape and assault. Minister Fritz said, “There have been numerous reports of SAPS acting heavy-handedly during the lockdown. I will be meeting with the Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General YolisaMatakata, and will urgently raise the matter of SAPS acting heavy-handedly towards residents. Brutality and heavy-handedness will not be tolerated and will be investigated by the relevant authority.” eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));Residents are asked to report any complaints of policing inefficiency to the Western Cape Police Ombudsman. Additionally, cases of police and military brutality should be reported to the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) or to Military Ombudsman respectively. “I again call on all citizens to stay at home and to practice social-distancing. Only by doing so can we as a community stop the spread. I reiterate that unless you have been exempted during Level Four restrictions, allowing you to return to work, you must stay at home. The virus spreads when people gather, and so you should avoid gatherings at all times,” said Minister Fritz. Minister Fritz said, “All reported incidents of lockdown contraventions will further be escalated to Provincial Joints Committee which are attended by both the SANDF and SAPS. Deployments and enforcement of the lockdown are being jointly coordinated by the Joint Command Centre, under the command of SANDF and SAPS.” eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));Useful contact details Western Cape Police Ombudsman: call 021 483 0669, email Ombudsman@wcpo.gov.za or visit www.westerncape.gov.za/police-ombudsman Military Ombudsman: email intake@milombud.org eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','0']));Independent Police Investigative Directorate: email complaints@ipid.gov.za or visit www.ipid.gov.za South African Police Service: 08600 10111 or use the MySAPS App Inefficiencies related to Law Enforcement: RichardGavin.Bosman@capetown.gov.za Law Enforcement: 021 480 7700/ 021 596 1999 Emergency Medical Service: 10177 or use Vodacom’s Emergency Services App eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-banner-1','ezslot_5',116,'0','0']));For further clarity on the conditions of lockdown, please see the following FAQs: https://www.westerncape.gov.za/department-of-health/frequently-asked-questions Issued by Cayla Ann Tomás Murray, Spokesperson, MEC Albert Fritz, 7 May 2020
