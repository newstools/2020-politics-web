Minister Sues Two CEOs For Defamation 27 May 2020 Having been outraged by the preposterous allegations in two “affidavits” and the highly defamatory comments given to the media on a range of allegations against the Minister and officials in the Ministry by the Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) of Amatola Water Board and Lepelle Northern Water Board, the Minister of Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation, Lindiwe Sisulu has consulted with her team of lawyers and has decided to sue the two CEOs and other individuals who joined them in this defamatory charade. “The allegations made are such gross and ridiculous fabrications that it can only come from very desperate people. They know that none of what they allege is true and their only intention is to defame. We expect persons who are employed by the State to act professionally. These attacks on the Minister and the officials of the Department are merely an outrageous attempt to sidetrack the investigation into their conduct”, Sisulu said. “Audits and forensic investigations are a normal part of good governance. The fact that these investigations should drive them to such allegations begs the question what are they afraid of”, added Sisulu. The Minister also added that she has instructed her lawyers to sue the two executives in their official and professional capacity and that state resources will not be used to pay for their legal troubles.
