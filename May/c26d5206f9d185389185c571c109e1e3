Patient stabbed to death at Bheki Mlangeni Hospital 11 May 2020 I am horrified at the murder of an 86-year-old patient allegedly by a 17-year-old mentally ill patient at the Bheki Mlangeni Hospital last week on Friday. The suspect apparently managed to get hold of a sharp object to stab the man multiple times and also injure another elderly patient. I have warned previously about inadequate facilities and security at this hospital as there have been at least seven previous assaults by psychiatric patients. Answers are needed as to why the hospital still does not have a properly staffed and dedicated psychiatric ward. There needs to be a full investigation and the hospital management held accountable for this terrible incident. Patients go to hospital to be healed, not killed. It is yet another reason to replace the hospital CEO Ruth Mabyana as the hospital has been poorly managed, including a jobs for pay scandal, since she was appointed six years ago when the hospital opened.
