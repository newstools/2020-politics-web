Patient stabbed to death at Bheki Mlangeni Hospital 11 May 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));I am horrified at the murder of an 86-year-old patient allegedly by a 17-year-old mentally ill patient at the Bheki Mlangeni Hospital last week on Friday. The suspect apparently managed to get hold of a sharp object to stab the man multiple times and also injure another elderly patient. I have warned previously about inadequate facilities and security at this hospital as there have been at least seven previous assaults by psychiatric patients. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));Answers are needed as to why the hospital still does not have a properly staffed and dedicated psychiatric ward. There needs to be a full investigation and the hospital management held accountable for this terrible incident. Patients go to hospital to be healed, not killed. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));It is yet another reason to replace the hospital CEO Ruth Mabyana as the hospital has been poorly managed, including a jobs for pay scandal, since she was appointed six years ago when the hospital opened.
