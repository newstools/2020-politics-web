President Ramaphosa’s address:eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0'])); President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to address the nation this evening where we hope he will announce a move to alert level three for the whole country. During the most recent President’s Coordinating Council meeting, the Western Cape presented on its hotspot strategy, which is focused on limiting the number of new infections in the areas where infections are highest, and responding to the impact of the coronavirus and the national lockdown through an all of government, data driven approach. Our health response includes identifying those most at risk, including healthcare workers, and repurposes our community screening and testing efforts to make sure that more can be done quicker, to save lives. This targeted approach, which enables more of the economy to open up while intervening rigorously in hotspots to slow the virus, also takes into consideration the very severe humanitarian crisis which is unfolding in South Africa today. This cannot be ignored. It will impact the lives of the most vulnerable in our communities who will no longer be able to put food on the table. We must do everything we can to save lives now, and we must do it in a way that also saves lives in the future. This must be based on the best available scientific advice at all times. This has been the Western Cape Government’s position. Recoveries:eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_5',115,'0','0'])); The Western Cape continues to record recoveries across the province, now approaching 7000. In Witzenberg, where our targeted hotspot plan was first piloted, over 80% of the total number of COVID-19 positive patients, have now recovered. In Khayelitsha, 60% of the total case load to date has recovered, and in the Tygerberg region, 56% of the total number of cases have already recovered. The role of citizens: We are working around the clock to make sure that we can provide care to every person who needs it. But we simply cannot do it alone. We need every single person to help us slow the spread, and in doing so, to save lives. eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-banner-1','ezslot_6',116,'0','0']));While you may not get seriously ill, those who are older, and those with underlying health conditions are at great risk. When you protect yourself, you protect these vulnerable groups too. How can you help? If you are sick, stay home and first call our hotline for advice. If you are battling to breath, seek urgent healthcare. Stay home as much as possible. Follow the golden rules of hygiene at all times, including regularly washing your hands and coughing into a tissue or the corner of your arm. Always wear a clean cloth mask when you go out in public. A mask alone will not protect you so always follow the golden rules of good hygiene too. Avoid all gatherings of people – this is where the virus spreads. Keep your distance from others – at least 1.5 metres. It is completely respectful and polite to tell someone to keep their distance if they are standing too close to you.If we all act in this way, we can interrupt the chain of transmission, slow the spread of the virus, and protect those we love. This is how we can all contribute to saving lives. Cuban doctors:eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-leader-1','ezslot_4',118,'0','0'])); Today, Western Cape Health Minister Nomafrench Mbombo and the HOD for the Department of Health, Dr Keith Cloete welcomed a cohort of Cuban doctors to the Western Cape. They form part of a group of over 200 doctors and medical specialists who came to South Africa from Cuba to assist in the response to COVID-19 as part of an agreement between Cuba, and the national Department of Health. We wish them well during their stay in the province. They will join the thousands of dedicated and skilled doctors, nurses and healthcare workers already working on the frontline response to the pandemic in the province. The province has also issued a call for people with medical experience to volunteer, and has received over 1000 applications. We will be calling on them to bolster our healthcare response as needed over the coming weeks and months. Issued by Western Cape Office of the Premier, 24 May 2020
