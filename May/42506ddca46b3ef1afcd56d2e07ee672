DA calls for urgent relief funding for Early Childhood Development sector 7 May 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) calls on the Minister of Social Development, Lindiwe Zulu, to urgently consider relief funding for the Early Childhood Development (ECD) sector during this Covid-19 lockdown. Minister Zulu has to date not given any indication if and when the Department of Social Development will extend relief funding to the sector that has been hit hard by the Covid-19 lockdown. Due to the current lockdown regulations, ECD centres have had to close their doors. This means that the majority of ECD operators do not have a source of income during this time. Not only have the livelihoods of ECD operators and caregivers been impacted, but the children who attend these centres will be affected as well. According to a recent report, an estimated 20 000 to 30 000 ECD operators run the risk of permanent closure, and close to 1 million children could be impacted should the government fail to extend relief towards the sector. The DA has been inundated with queries and concerns from ECD role-players who have raised alarms on Government’s failure to intervene in what could potentially turn into a crisis. There has been no clear communication on whether the ECD sector will be considered for relief during this period and the Department has seemingly turned a blind eye to their valid concerns. The minister must give clarity on when  ECD centres are to reopen, because now  that we have moved to level 4,  many of the parents who are returning to work will need clarity on the care of their children. Government must ensure that the necessary relief is made available because early childhood development is too important for our country's future and cannot be allowed to collapse.
