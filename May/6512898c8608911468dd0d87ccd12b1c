DA forces government to reopen anti-corruption watchdog 8 May 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomes the quick about-turn announced today by Public Service and Administration Minister Senzo Mchunu on designating the Public Service Commission (PSC) as a “non-essential” institution. Following an announcement from the DA this morning that we were preparing to challenge the constitutionality of the government’s irrational decision to designate South Africa’s premier public service anti-corruption watchdog as “non-essential,” Mchunu a few hours later announced that the government had changed its mind, and designated the PSC as the essential services it is. The DA has won an important victory for good governance and anti-corruption. Without a functioning PSC, ANC cadres would have been able to take looting in the public service to even greater heights that under the corruption nightmare that already plagues South Africa. Amidst reports of escalating corruption by ANC apparatchiks, including looting of food parcels meant to feed starving citizens, we encourage members of the public as well as public servants to make use of the PSC’s anti-corruption hotline, which the DA has now reopened, by phoning 0800 701 701 or sending an SMS complaint to 39772. The DA will continue to closely monitor the situation, including to ensure that all the necessary legal regulations are published so that the PSC can fulfil its vital function. We however remain concerned that, without the swift intervention of the DA, the government of Cyril Ramaphosa was more than happy to let anti-corruption efforts fall by the wayside at a time when vigilance has never been more urgent. As the official opposition, we will never stand for this, and the DA will continue to fight for an end to the lockdown crisis measures that threatens the very foundation of our democratic institutions.
