ANC Tshwane Councillor allegedly distributing food parcels from his home  4 May 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) has been reliably informed that the ANC Tshwane Municipality Councillor, Tshepo Mudau is allegedly distributing food parcels from his home in Mabopane Extension, Tshwane. It is alleged that Councillor Mudau has been distributing food parcels to some of the residents since this morning. The photos of the residents receiving food parcels from the Councillor’s home can be obtained here, here, here and here. This goes against the directive issued by the Acting Gauteng MEC for Social Development, Panyaza Lesufi that no public representatives should be involved in the distribution of food parcels. Furthermore, the department issued a letter of authorisation to donors which states that only the department is facilitating and receiving donations from all organisations, companies, civil society bodies and individual citizens who would like to assist. All donations must be delivered to the Booysen warehouse in the City of Johannesburg and if an organisation wishes to distribute food or any donations directly to the communities they need to abide by the stipulated conditions. The DA calls on the MEC to urgently investigate these allegations and ensure that everyone abides by the department’s directive in terms of food parcel distribution. Should these allegations prove to be true, the Councillor must face the consequences for his action. Issued by Refiloe Nt’sekhe, DA Gauteng Shadow MEC for Social Development, 4 May 2020
