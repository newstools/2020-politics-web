Cape Town International Airport voted best in Africa for the fifth time 11 May 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));This accolade is a massive vote of confidence in our airport and I congratulate the CTIA, their team and all those involved in making this fantastic achievement possible, especially during these trying times. This award is yet another one on their impressive list of accomplishments. Last week, together with our official Destination Marketing Organisation, Cape Town Tourism (CTT), we detailed plans to plot a sustainable future for the tourism sector. We also launched the City’s Economic Action Plan, which sets out how we recover from the economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis. Central to these plans is our award-winning and world class airport to bring back our tourists and to take our local goods across the world. Through the City’s Department of Enterprise and Investment, we have a good working relationship with the CTIA and we continue to have the City’s Place Marketing branding at the airport to create connections between travellers and our beautiful city. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));The City will continue our partnership with CTIA to market Cape Town because we need to stay top of mind for when travel is allowed to resume and to ensure that we can welcome tourists back. We will also continue to explore ways to bring the Cape Town Aerotropolis to life as this is another key aspect of our city’s economic recovery. Slowly but surely the green shoots, which point to the beginnings of new growth and recovery, are starting to show. I continue to work with all stakeholders to ensure that we are able to weather this storm. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));We are confident that together with our special business partners and the recovery plans we have in place, that we will come back from this crisis, stronger than before and ready to share all Cape Town has to offer.
