Outbreak of African Swine Fever in Eastern Cape 12 May 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));Agri SA and its affiliated members, Agri Eastern Cape and the  South African Pork Producers Organisation (SAPPO) have committed to working with government to ensure the outbreak of African Swine Fever (ASF) in the Amathole District Municipality in the Eastern Cape is contained and handled as well as possible in the interests of commercial and small scale pig farmers alike. The outbreak occurred in a communal setting, which makes movement control and biosecurity between pig herds difficult. According to the Director of Animal Health at the Department of Agriculture, Dr Mpho Maja, the culling of pigs in the area of the reported outbreak is not currently being considered. The area has, however, been placed under quarantine. SAPPO CEO, Johan Kotze, affirmed that it is imperative to ensure that an accurate and effective communication strategy be followed to allay any potential fears and misconceptions about ASF and to inform pig keepers in the affected area on how the disease is spread and how they can protect their pigs from the virus. Control measures include that all infected pigs should be kept as far as possible from those that are not so as to limit the spread of the disease. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));“The importance of a strong working relationship between organised agriculture and government in dealing with outbreak of ASF in the Eastern Cape cannot be overstated” says Janse Rabie, Head of Agri SA’s Natural Resources Centre of Excellence. “We are very fortunate to have the necessary structures and communication channels in place with both government and rural communities. We are confident that together we will be able to handle the situation.” ASF does not affect humans and the consumption of pork is safe. However, any meat and products from affected pigs can be a source of infection to other pigs. Farmers/pig keepers are requested to be vigilant and to report any sudden illness and deaths in their pigs to the local State Veterinary office immediately so that swift action can be initiated to prevent the spread of the disease.
