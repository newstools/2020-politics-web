This translates to approxi- mately 5% of all COVID-19 confirmed patients and this is consistent with the hospitalization rates that were seen in China. Our mortality rate has remained stable at around 1.9% since the first death was reported. This is below the world average which is 3.4% as estimated by the World Health Organisation As a reminder to all South Africans, the principle of flattening the curve is to limit the spread of the infection such that the numbers do not rise to the extent that they overwhelm the health care system. As Winter sets in we will be confronted with the additional burden of influenza and other pneumonias, bronchiolitis in children, exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive air- ways disease and winter related trauma, like burns injuries. I therefore urge each and every South African to continue to play your part in easing the load on the health care system- stay home if you do not have to venture out, wear a mask at all times in public places, wash your hands regularly and disinfect surfaces you normally come into contact with. I also urge employers whose businesses have opened to take all the necessary measures to protect their employees. I salute our health professionals- our doctors, nurses, care workers, community workers, al- lied health professionals, medical technicians, pharmacists, porters, cleaners, laboratory technicians and all our foot soldiers in the front line of health care who continue to serve un- der these trying times.
