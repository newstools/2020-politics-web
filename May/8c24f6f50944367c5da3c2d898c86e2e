Pretoria and Johannesburg ranked amongst top ten most dangerous cities in the world 11 May 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng notes with great concern that the province’s two big cities, Pretoria and Johannesburg have been ranked amongst the top ten most dangerous cities in the world by the Numbeo’s 2020 Crime Index. According to the Numbeo’s 2020 Crime Index, four South African cities are among the ten most dangerous cities globally. These cities are ranked as follows: 3. Pietermaritzburg 4. Pretoria 5. Durban 6. Johannesburg eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));These rankings are worrying and clearly indicates that our cities lack adequate policing and that our people’s lives and safety is under serious threat. South Africans do not feel safe in their homes and communities as crime continues to rise while the SAPS is riddling with corruption and unable to fight crime. For the longest time the DA has been calling for the professionalisation of SAPS so as to make the police force honest, professional and one that serves and protects all South Africans. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));Furthermore, our police are ill-equipped, untrained and under-resourced to adequately ensure that law and order is maintained in our communities, and that there are effective arrests, prosecutions and convictions of criminals. The DA will continue to call for the establishment of specialised units within SAPS to help combat crime. We will also be tabling questions to the Gauteng MEC for Community Safety, Faith Mazibuko in the Gauteng Provincial Legislature (GPL) to determine what measures are being put in place to more effectively fight crime in Johannesburg and Pretoria.
