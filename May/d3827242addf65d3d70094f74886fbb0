Recovery from serious illness: Earlier today, Health Minister Nomafrench Mbombo visited the Gatesville Melomed Hospital to celebrate the recovery of Bathandwa Zuzo, from Gugulethu.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','0'])); Minister Mbombo said: "Mr Zuzo tested positive for COVID-19 and was admitted on the 26 April 2020, with severe respiratory problems. He was in ICU and on ventilators for 3 weeks. This also serves to demonstrate the strength of our health system and to showcase our health professionals’ skills in dealing with this pandemic. This is a powerful story of a man who survived the most severe case of this virus, I hope this will give hope to the people who have been diagnosed with COVID-19." It is also important that we show our support for those who are ill- and treat them with kindness and care on their path to recovery. Minister Madikizela launches Red Dot transport service: Today the Western Cape Minister of Transport and Public Works, Bonginkosi Madikizela, launched the Red Dot Service. This forms part of our targeted hotspot response strategy for the Covid-19 pandemic in the Western Cape. This partnership between the Western Cape Government and the minibus taxi industry will deliver critical transport services needed during this challenging time. This Red Dot service (which refers to the sticker on the bus) will provide a chartered transport service for those Department of Health employees who need to travel for work between 19:00 and 05:00. This is difficult outside of these hours because of limitation of transport under Alert Level 4 restrictions.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-banner-1','ezslot_5',116,'0','0'])); From 1 June, the service will also  transport citizens who have tested positive for COVID-19 or are at high-risk of having been exposed to the virus to public isolation and quarantine centres in the Western Cape.  The fleet will initially comprise 100 minibuses and will follow strict safety and hygiene protocols, including the rigorous cleaning and sanitization of vehicles after every trip. We are extremely thankful to SANTACO Western Cape for supporting this initiative, as we find innovative ways to make sure that we can assist our residents. Minister Anroux Marais supports creativity for young learners during the lockdown: The Western Cape Minister of Cultural Affairs and Sport announced educational resources available for young learners during the Lockdown. An online resource portal for NGOs to share has been developed through a  partnership of the Department of Cultural Affairs and Sport’s After School Programme, the Learning Trust, ASSITEJ-SA, and the Laureus Sport for Good Foundation. The Department is also developing printed materials to be used by learners who can’t access the material online, while the site is being zero-rated.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-large-leaderboard-2','ezslot_6',117,'0','0'])); I am grateful for the support of these organisations, as we continue to ensure the education of our children receives the attention it deserves.

Minister Tertius Simmers announces new homes as government work continues through the pandemic: Yesterday Minister Simmers announced that 1371 beneficiaries will benefit from new homes that are ready to be handed over across the Western Cape. This includes 267 houses in the Cape Metro and some 229 housing opportunities in Ceres, which is within the Witzenberg municipality. Our government is continuing to work hard throughout this pandemic to continue to deliver on its mandate, and I am excited that these residents will soon move into their new homes. Improving the lives of vulnerable communities is our top priority and a critical part of the response to the pandemic.

Recoveries: We are pleased to report that over 3500 people in the province have recovered from COVID-19 infections. The rate of recovery in Witzenberg now stands at 70% of all cases, and in the Western region, half of all recorded cases to date have recovered.  These are especially promising numbers as both of these areas are considered hotspots in the province. The majority of people will only experience mild symptoms and 90% of patients will not need to be hospitalised.  While many will recover without complications, we must not underestimate the impact of the COVID-19 virus, especially on the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions. The infection curve in the Western Cape is moving faster, and we are seeing higher rates of community transmission. Currently, the Western Cape death rate stands at 1.68% of the total caseload. This is in line with international norms. Our data also shows us that the overwhelming majority of COVID-19 positive people who have died in the province have had one or more comorbidities.  It is therefore imperative that vulnerable residents take extra precautions- by staying home as much as possible to reduce the risk of infection, and by strictly abiding to the golden rules- including frequent hand washing and other hygiene measures, keeping a distance of at least 1.5 metres from any other person and by wearing a clean, cloth mask when leaving the house. We can all help to protect the vulnerable by sticking to these same golden rules. Those residents who live with a member of the family who may be vulnerable, must be vigilant to ensure that they do not put their loved ones at additional risk. Our hotspot plan is systematically addressing infections in nine geographic locations in the province, using the skills, data and experience available across government departments. We are working with the other spheres of government, law enforcement, NGOs and faith based organisations, however, we cannot do this work alone. It requires every one of us to step up and take responsibility to ensure that we are actively doing everything we can to protect ourselves and our loved ones. This is how we will stop the spread.
