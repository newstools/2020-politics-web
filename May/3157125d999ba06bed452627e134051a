Together we succeeded in flattening the curve, which facilitated ramping up and cohesion of our health care system as well as preparation of our spaces as we resume our economic and social development. A few examples is that we have screened 10 737 341 citizens, we now have 376 sites identified for quarantine nationally with 30 823 quarantine beds. Significantly our mortality rate, 1.8%, remains well below the global average which is currently 6.6% and our recovery rate is 42.4%, above the global average of 38%. The process of easing lockdown regulations is a highly consultative one where various stakeholder inputs are taken into account to influence implementation. We remain guided by the World Health Organization recommendations for easing lockdown restrictions, which are: 1. Strong surveillance, cases are declining and transmission is controlled2. Health systems capacity is in place to detect, isolate, test and treat every case and trace very contact3. That outbreak risks are minimized especially in settings like facilities and nursing homes4. That preventive measures are in place in workplaces, schools and other places that are essential for people to go5. That importation of cases can be managed6. That communities are fully educated, engaged and empowered to adjust to the new norm The Director General of WHO Dr. Tedros Ghebreyesus continued by saying: “The risk of returning to lockdown remains very real if countries do not manage the transition extremely carefully and in a phased approach.” Previous: 15 May 2020 Update As of today, the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in South Africa is 13 524 Case Data Province New cases on 15 May 2020 Total cases for 15 May 2020 Percentage total Eastern Cape 93 1662 12,3 Free State 6 151 1,1 Gauteng 75 2210 16,3 KwaZulu-Natal 38 1482 11,0 Limpopo 2 57 0,4 Mpumalanga 0 67 0,5 North West 5 63 0,5 Northern Cape 3 34 0,3 Western Cape 563 7798 57,7 Unknown 0 0 0,0 Total 785 13524 100,0 Testing Data 421 555 tests have been conducted with 18 537 done in the last 24 hour cycle.
