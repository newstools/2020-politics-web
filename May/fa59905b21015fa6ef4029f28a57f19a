For every litre of participating Engen lubricant sold nationwide, R1 will be contributed to Agri SA’s Drought Aid Fund. Since 2015, thousands of South African farmers and farm workers impacted by drought have benefited from the fund. Engen is proud to be a part of this initiative given its close and longstanding ties to the agricultural sector. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0'])); “As a leading supplier of fuels and lubricants to the agricultural sector we have witnessed first-hand the impact that the ongoing drought has on our farmers, farm workers and farming communities, which is why we have partnered with Agri SA to ensure the sustainability of this sector,” says Zama Dyaphu, the Indirect Sales Manager for Engen Lubricants. With the impact of drought being felt in the Northern Cape, Limpopo, and parts of the Eastern and Western Cape, Agri SA is thankful for the opportunity to partner with Engen. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));“The contribution of Engen will go a long way to assist farmers, farm workers and farming communities who are still suffering from this long-lasting drought.

Customers who purchase Engen Dieselube 700 Super, Engen Agritrac Super Universal and Engen Agrifluid Transmission from participating co-ops and distributers will ensure that R1 per litre is contributed to the Drought Aid Fund.
