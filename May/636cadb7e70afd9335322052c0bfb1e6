SACP condemns attacks on Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma 28 May 2020 The South African Communist Party (SACP) strongly condemns the sustained attacks on the Minister of Co-Operative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma. Cde Dlamini-Zuma is being singled out from the Cabinet and attacked for decisions that have been taken collectively by the National Coronavirus Command Council and the Cabinet, and President Cyril Ramaphosa has consistently explained and clarified this matter. There can be no other conclusion than that the attacks on Dr Dlamini-Zuma are underpinned by dubious intentions. The agenda comprises a drive to project the Cabinet as divided and pit the President against the Minister or vice versa. Furthermore, and taking the entire spectrum of the media including social media networks into account, it is clear that the attacks on Dr Dlamini-Zuma comprise patriarchal and sexist attitudes, and also seek to project the President as a weak leader. The SACP calls upon the Alliance and all formations of our movement to close ranks and decisively confront and expose the attacks on Dr Dlamini-Zuma for what they are â€“ a divisive agenda that seeks to weaken the entire ANC-led movement and divert government from leading the fight against the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. The SACP will not fold its arms and stand aside in the face of these sustained attacks, and we further call upon our SACP cadres, and indeed all the cadres of our movement as well as all other democratic South Africans, to strengthen their active role in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.
