This can be done by calling 021 483 0669 or by emailing ombudsman@wcpo.gov.za.” Minister Fritz added, “Every single person has a responsibility in “flattening the curve”. We need to abide by the law, and keep a safe distance at all times. You must stay home if you can, and you must avoid all gatherings, because this is how the virus spreads. If you are going out in public, wear a cloth mask. It must always be done in conjunction with the five golden rules of good hygiene.” eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));For further clarity on the conditions of lockdown, please see the following FAQs: https://www.westerncape.gov.za/department-of-health/frequently-asked-questions Issued by Cayla Ann Tomás Murray, Spokesperson for Minister Albert Fritz, 14 May 2020
