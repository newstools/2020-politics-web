SAPS provides answers about extension of amnesty after pressure from AfriForum 21 May 2020 Brig. Lawrence Nkgweng replied earlier today to AfriForum’s letter to Bheki Cele, Minister of Police, about the possible extension of the firearms amnesty period. Nkgweng indicated that Cele had indeed approached Parliament to have the amnesty period extended by letters – with the necessary documentation - directed to the Speaker of the National Assembly as well as the Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces. The Minister now awaits replies from the Portfolio Commission of Police, as well as the Select Committee on Security and Justice, as this request must first go through these two committees before it can be referred to the National Council of Provinces and eventually the National Assembly for approval. “The conformation by the SAPS is a welcome turn of events for firearm owners who want to make use of the amnesty period. AfriForum is inundated with telephone calls in this regard which was one of the reasons why we put increased pressure on the SAPS,” says Marnus Kamfer, AfriForum’s Legal and Risk Manager for Community Safety. AfriForum approached Cele on 20 May 2020 about a possible extension of the amnesty period after the organisation pointed out in letters dated 25 and 30 March 2020 that firearm owners who would want to make use of the amnesty period may have been hindered by the lockdown.
