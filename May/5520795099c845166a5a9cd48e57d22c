MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube on raids done in KwaZulu-Natal during Coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic 14 May 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));Yesterday I pointed out that KwaZulu-Natal is the only province that we have. And I offered to ensure that we hand it over to future generations in a good condition. It should be remembered that in March, I undertook not to turn a blind eye to complaints from consumers. I wish to confirm that another raid started at 10h30 in Durban and it is still underway. This follows a complaint through our Consumer Complaints Unit. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));Inspectors from the department working with law enforcement agencies seized a hijacked building in 107 Gale Street, (MagwazaMaphalala) in Durban. About 60 people were found inside the building and 14 undocumented foreign nationals have been arrested. The building has been handed over to eThekwini Municipality. Shockingly, we discovered that there is a syndicate involved in issuing fraudulent trading permits to undocumented foreign nationals. Consequently, 4 business have been shut down for using fraudulent trading permits and violating lockdown regulations. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));I commend the MEC for Transport, Community Safety and Liaison Bheki Ntuli for strengthening our efforts aimed at protecting our economy. Equally, I extend my appreciation to mayors of municipalities who are working with our inspectors and law enforcement agencies throughout the corners of the province. Importantly, we cannot win this battle without the support from law abiding citizens of this province. We are inundated with tip-offs and complaints from members of the public. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','0']));As the department, we remain firm and focused on dealing a permanent blow to a very professional and sophisticated big racket which is using what could appear as a legitimate businesses. Clearly, some of these unscrupulous elements have hijacked buildings as we discovered today. It is in these places where they keep expired and counterfeit goods which are sold to unsuspecting members of the public. More investigations are being conducted to ensure that the wheels of justice grind slowly but exceedingly fine behind those responsible for the hijacking of buildings. Last week, I indicated that South African Revenue Services reported to us that these syndicates exploit differential taxes of highly-taxed goods such as cigarettes, alcohol, petroleum and others products. They sometimes choose not to declare their goods or they bribe officials or they transport their goods through illegal and unmonitored routes. eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-banner-1','ezslot_5',116,'0','0']));The syndicates are also involved in fraudulent transactions involving under-declarations of imported goods. They are known to double-invoice for the purpose of using undervalued invoices for declarations. In order to protect our economy, we are determined to stamp out this tidal wave of lawlessness that is sweeping through the province. A team of experienced officials from the department are on standby to investigate complaints regarding excessive pricing and violation of Business Regulations.
