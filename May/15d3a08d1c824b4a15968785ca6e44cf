Millions spent on paying GPG employees’ overtime 26 May 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng is extremely concerned about the exorbitant amount of money spent on overtime by the Gauteng Provincial Government (GPG) over the last five years. This was revealed to me by the MECs for Finance and e-Government; Infrastructure Development and Property Management; Education; Economic Development and Agriculture and Rural Development; Sports, Arts, Culture and Recreation and Social Development in a written reply to my questions tabled in the Gauteng Provincial Legislature (GPL). The departments have spent the following amount on overtime over the last five financial years: Infrastructure Development and Property Management- R100 321 255.00 Finance and e-Government – R1 522 100.00 Education- R75 500 000.00 eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_1',114,'0','0']));Economic Development and Agriculture and Rural Development- R16 460 430.57 Social Development – R3 028 823. 34 Roads and Transport- R9 218 062, 55 If the trend over the last five years regarding the amount of money paid in overtime continues, it means the wage bill will not be kept at 60%. This is concerning as the economy is not doing well and in order for this to improve a directive was given by the National Minister of Finance, Tito Mboweni to keep the wage bill at 60%. Where departments need to have Annual Performance Plans (APP) in place it does not appear that they are adhering to these plans. This points to poor planning by the Gauteng Provincial Government. The only way this can be mitigated is by ensuring that each and every department submits an APP that details exactly how they will be cutting down on overtime in the new financial year. Failure to do so will lead to a wage bill that is far higher than 60%. The DA will be closely monitoring each department to ensure that their APPs are submitted for the 2020/2021 financial year and to determine what plans have been put in place to curb overtime spend.
