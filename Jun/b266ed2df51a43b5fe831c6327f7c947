Two police officers who falsely accused a colleague of using the k-word to be sentenced on Friday 18 June 2020 Two members of the South African Police Service (SAPS) are facing possible prison sentences after they had falsely accused a colleague of using the k-word. Two warrant officers of the SAPS, SedisaTikoe and Chris Mphana, were convicted of various criminal charges by the North West Regional Court in Stilfontein, including crimen injuria, obstructing the course of justice, perjury and assault. They will be sentenced on Friday, 19 June. These two falsely accused Lieutenant Colonel Annemarie Oosthuizen of using the k-word and they threatened her with violence. The false accusations followed after Oosthuizen had started a disciplinary process against them for failing to show up at work without permission or without taking leave. Solidarity supported Oosthuizen throughout the process, and the union welcomed the conviction. “False accusations of using the k-word are increasingly being used as a weapon to avoid disciplinary action. Although not limited to the SAPS, there are several similar cases in the SAPS. The labour courts see a false charge of racism as racism and unfair discrimination. The criminal courts see it as a criminal offense and you can go to prison for that,” said Solidarity Chief Executive Dr Dirk Hermann.eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','1'])); A former intern, Ms Elizabeth Sechele, heard Tikoe and Mphana planning to falsely accuse Oosthuizen of using the k-word. Sechele testified in court that she was a mother herself and could not allow Oosthuizen to lose her job for an unlawful reason. She said her father encouraged her to do the right thing. “The real hero in this case is Elizabeth Sechele. She showed that justice does not know colour. She stood up for the truth despite intimidation,” Hermann said. Sentencing in the three-year long criminal case will take place in Stilfontein on 19 June.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_4',114,'0','0'])); Issued by Renate Barnard, Sector Coordinator: Public Sector, 18 June 2020
