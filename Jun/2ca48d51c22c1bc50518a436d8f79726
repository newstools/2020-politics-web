IFP rejects the EFF’s bogus claim that it is part of a syndicate that has captured the City of Johannesburg 12 June 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[468,60],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_5',112,'0','0']));The IFP in Gauteng has noted the unfounded claims that we are part of what the EFF describes as a “Gangster paradise characterised by political puppeteering” of the Mayor of the City of Johannesburg by “convicted criminals, threats, blackmailing, purging and blatant looting”. Although shocked, we are not surprised by these baseless allegations because we are aware that the EFF is worried by the (GLU) Government Local Unit’s commitment to cleaning out the indescribable mess left by the previous administration controlled unofficially controlled by the EFF. The difference between that confusion and the current GLU is that nobody is captured but rather, we are equal partners, working together to clean up the mess left by Mashaba and EFF. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_3',113,'0','0']));We therefore unconditionally reject this misguided accusation made by the EFF Regional Chairperson, Musa Novela, who, it is well-documented, captured the former Mayor of Johannesburg and allegedly mooted that the Mayor does as he says. We further take seriously the call made by him to all Councillors to isolate the so-called “criminal band of the IFP, Gayton Mackenzie and the Mayor”. We want to put it on record that the IFP is unashamedly providing leadership and stability in all the municipalities that we are represented in, hence there is stability in Mogale City, Ekurhuleni and the City of Johannesburg. Ours is a leadership that is concerned with service delivery and not cheap political gimmicks that are the essence of some political outfits. On that note, we would like to openly challenge the EFF and its Regional Chair to bring forth the evidence to support their malicious claims that we are part of a syndicate that has captured the city. Further, we will soon be exposing their shenanigans of the capturing of the previous administration and the City of Johannesburg.
