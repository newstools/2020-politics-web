Our schools are only now beginning to return to the so-called ‘new normal’ and the DA condemns this blatant attack in the strongest terms. This despicable act will have a severe ripple effect on teaching and learning at Masijbule High School. The DA conveys its deepest sympathies to this school community. The DA calls on the South African Police Service (SAPS) to act swiftly so that the perpetrator or perpetrators are apprehended and so that the law can take its course. A strong message must be sent out that crime against innocent citizens will not be tolerated.
