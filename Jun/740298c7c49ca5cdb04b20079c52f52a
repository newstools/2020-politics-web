Letter to Minister Mboweni: We Cannot Be Flippant About Collapsing the Economy 3 June 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));Yesterday I wrote to Finance Minister, Tito Mboweni, encouraging him to challenge the recent utterances of senior ANC leaders advocating for the collapse of our economy in the wake of COVID-19. In the attached letter, I express my outrage for the school of thinking that seems at place in the former Soviet Union, and the sheer ignorance of these ANC regarding the suffering that comes with an economic collapse. As South Africans we have to challenge the Bell Pottinger style efforts of the ANC to racialise and demonise our economy, as an effort to distract from their fundamental failures over the last 26 years to achieve of economic redress in our country. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));The ANC’s response to MzwandileMasina’s comments are a slap in the face of our country. Any party serious about our economy, investor confidence or caring for the almost 11 million unemployed South Africans, as well as the further 3 to 7 million that stand to lose their jobs this year, would realise they have subjected Ekurhuleni to the wrong Mayor and replace him. I look forward to Minister Mboweni’s response, because he appears to remain steadfast in his commitment to economic reform in the face of populism and pandering within the ANC.
