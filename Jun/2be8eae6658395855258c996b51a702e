More data is available here: https://coronavirus.westerncape.gov.za/covid-19-dashboard The Western Cape has recorded an additional 42 deaths, bringing the total number of COVID-19 related deaths in the province to 966. We send our condolences to the families and loved ones of the deceased at this time. Recoveries:eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0'])); The Western Cape has now recorded over 26 000 recoveries, representing a total of 68% of all cases registered to date. In the Tygerberg sub-district which has the highest number of infections in the province, 75% of all cases have recovered so far, and in Khayelitsha which has the second highest number of infections, the recovery rate stands at 79% Many people who contract COVID-19 will have mild symptoms and most will recover without any need for hospitalisation. But this does not mean that we should be any less careful- as you could experience mild symptoms, but you could also pass on the virus to your parents or grandparents, or someone in one of the high risk groups. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','0']));People with existing comorbidities are more at risk of becoming severely ill if they contract COVID-19. Those most at risk include those who are: Individuals with comorbidities, at any age 55 years an older, with or without co-morbidities The overwhelming majority of COVID-19 positive people who have died in the province have had one or more comorbidities.  Co-morbidity is the presence of one or more additional diseases or conditions occurring with a primary medical condition. The most prevalent comorbidities in deaths due to COVID-19 across all age groups in the Western Cape are diabetes and hypertension. Other common comorbidities also include HIV, kidney, lung and heart disease. Deaths:eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-banner-1','ezslot_5',116,'0','0'])); Today, we have also sadly surpassed the 1000 deaths mark. Each of these people is mourned by loved ones who miss them terribly. They have all played a role in our society- the numbers include essential workers like healthcare workers and law enforcement officers, people who worked hard everyday to provide for their families, parents, grandparents, and people who were part of our communities. We send our deepest condolences to all of those who have lost a loved one to COVID-19. We know that many more people will become sick and we will lose more lives but we must all do everything we can to ensure that we slow the spread of the virus. We all need to make the golden rules of infection prevention a part of our daily lives. We should all still be staying at home as much as possible, washing our hands regularly and cleaning surfaces like counter tops, desks and door handles at home and at work. When you do leave home, ensure that you are wearing a clean cloth mask and keep that 1.5 metre distance between you and any other person when you're standing in queues, waiting for the bus or you're in any area where people are congregating. For those who fall into the vulnerable groups, it's important that you continue to take additional steps to protect yourself by staying at home, and being vigilant about hand-washing and hygiene. These steps can help us all to save lives. Issued by Western Cape Office of the Premier, 13 June 2020
