Red Cross Testing and Triage Centre:eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0'])); Today, Health Minister Nomafrench Mbombo and I had the opportunity to visit the new temporary testing and triage facility at the Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital. The facility provides a space where children entering the hospital for treatment can be screened or tested separately from the children already receiving treatment in the hospital. The hospital has a dedicated ward for children who are deemed to be persons under investigation and will also admit a parent or caregiver who will be able to stay with while in the hospital. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','0']));The contractors who built the temporary testing centre have also sponsored some beautiful panels featuring colourful drawings and inspirational quotes in English, Afrikaans and isiXhosa, which help to make the space more child friendly. The Western Cape Government has already built 18 testing and triage centres in the province in the first phase, with another 14 planned for the metro region and an additional 20 for our non-metro regions. These triage centres help to ease the pressure on emergency rooms, while also allowing a dedicated space for screening and testing to occur, away from the hospital's day to day activities. Today, the Western Cape Government also released the details of its new risk adjusted strategy for testing. More information on that strategy, which is aimed at using our testing in the Cape Town metro region, to test those who need it most and to protect the vulnerable, can be found here: https://coronavirus.westerncape.gov.za/news/statement-premier-alan-winde-our-testing-strategy-focused-saving-lives Anyone seeking advice on COVID-19 can call the hotline on 021 928 4102.
