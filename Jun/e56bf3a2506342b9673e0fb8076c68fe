Solidarity to confront Maimane in court regarding his application that schools should close and SA return to level 4  15 June 2020eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0'])); Solidarity has entered into the legal battle in which former DA leader and One SA Movement leader Mmusi Maimane asks the court to order the closing of the 23 000 schools in South Africa. Maimane furthermore demands that the country should return to Level 4 lockdown regulations from the current Level 3 lockdown regulations. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));Solidarity, as a friend of the court, argues that it would not be in the best interests of children, teachers and education in general for schools to close again. Solidarity filed its court documents today. Solidarity also argues that there is no need to make a choice between health and education; the choice should be to receive education in a healthy way. In addition, Solidarity says there is no need to make a choice between health and work. The choice must be to work in a healthy way. “It is clear that Maimane and his organisation want to continue and deepen the devastating effects of the lockdown regulations on people. He wants to send children home who can learn in a healthy way, and he wants teachers and other employed people who can work in a healthy way and earn a living to continue feeling anxious and uncertain. If Maimane gets his way, thousands more people will lose their jobs and it will become impossible to save the school programme,” said Solidarity Chief Executive Dr Dirk Hermann. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));Maimane said in his statement, “Now is the time to intensify the lockdown, to close schools and to keep people in their homes.” “The country finds itself in an economic crisis; it is essential to work and go to school in a responsible and safe manner. Solidarity will continue to fight for learners’ right to receive education, and for the right of teachers and other working people to work,” Dr Hermann added. The case will be heard at 10:00 on Wednesday, 17 June, in the Pretoria High Court.
