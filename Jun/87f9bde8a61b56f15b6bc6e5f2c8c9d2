Crime and punishment in contemporary South Africa III – From crime reporting to cases finalised 2 June 2020 INTRODUCTIONeval(ez_write_tag([[468,60],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0'])); Once a crime is reported to the police, the next stage is detection and compilation of a docket for consideration by the National Prosecuting Authority. Data in this brief come from SAPS and NPA Annual Reports and are spotty, because there is no standard year to year format for information in either set of reports. CRIME DETECTION eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));Table 1 sets out crime detection rates and total crimes detected. Table 1: Crime detection rates  2014/15 2015/16 2016/17 2017/18 2018/19       Contact crime 54.3% 53.1% 52.3% 51.1% 50.6% Other community reported crime 28.7%   27.4% 28.1% Police detected crime 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% All crime 47.6%   49.2% 47.1% All detected crimes 1,040,205   1,034,871 950,747 Just over a half of contact crime (murder, attempted murder, sexual offences, assault and robbery) are detected, compared with just over a quarter of other community reported crime. Police detected crime is ipso facto detected. This means that just under half of all crimes are detected, leading to about a million detected crimes a year. THE NATIONAL PROSECUTING AUTHORITYeval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0'])); Between 2016/17 and 2018/19, the NPA received an annual average of 933, 933 new dockets. Virtually all of them were processed by the NPA, who then declined to prosecute in 491,986 cases (53% of the total), referred 323,105 (35% of the total) of the total back to the police for further investigation and initiated 116,306 prosecutions (12% of the total). The NPA also initiated 176 diversions (into a non-trial process) and 2,017 informal mediations. Dockets referred back would either not be resubmitted, or resubmitted followed by a decision to prosecute or not to prosecute, or resubmitted followed a further referral back. Statistical evidence on the operation of the referral back process is not available, but it must over time unleash a further wave of prosecutions. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','0']));For 2016/17, we have data on the disposition of new dockets in regional and district courts. Table 2: Disposition of new dockets 2016/17  Regional courts District courts New dockets received 119,234 777,196 Declined to prosecute 43,298 430,363 Further investigation 57,270 253,710 Prosecution instituted 18,940 91,687 Total disposition 119,508 775,760 Since regional courts deal with more serious cases, it is not surprising that they show a greater inclination to institute prosecutions and refer dockets back for further investigation and a lower inclination to decline to prosecute than district courts. COURT ENROLLMENT STATISTICS Court enrollment statistics illuminate little except churn. In 2014/15, 908,634 cases were enrolled in the courts and 435,175 were removed from the rolls. The distribution of the reasons for removal is set out in Table 3. Table 3eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-banner-1','ezslot_5',116,'0','0'])); Cases removed from court rolls 435,175 Withdrawals 130,547 Warrants for arrest and subpoenas 139,599 Transfers to other courts 45,647 Referrals for mental observation 1,718 Struck off roll 117,664 That a case is removed from a court roll does not mean that it cannot be reinstated in the same or another court. FINALISED CASES NPA Annual Reports indicate that 481,442 cases were finalized per year on average between 2014/15 and 2018/19. Of these, 164, 881 (34% of the total) were settled using alternative dispute resolution. ADR is not used in high court cases, and settled only 8% of cases in the regional courts. It is much more widely used in district courts. Cases going to trial usually end in convictions. Table 4: Cases finalised and outcomes Annual average 2014/15 to 2018/19      High courts Regional courts District courts All courts Cases 998 33,810 446,633 481,442 Outcomes     Informal mediation  2,352 114,900 117,252 Diversion  317 47,313 47,629 Subtotal - Alternative Dispute Resolution  2,668 162,213 164,881 Trials 998 31,034 284,421 316,453 Guilty 905 24,711 271,674 297,290 Acquitted 93 6,323 12,747 19,163 Conviction rate 90.7% 79.6% 95.5% 93.9% That finalized cases far exceed prosecutions initiated right away from new dockets suggests that dockets referred to the police for further investigation usually result in prosecution down the line. FROM REPORTED CRIME TO ARREST: EVIDENCE FROM THE VOCS Table 5 sets arrest rates (arrests divided by crimes reported to the police in 2014/15 and 2016/17 to 2018/19) for five categories of crime: Table 5 Theft of motor vehicles 17% Housebreaking/burglary 14% Home robbery 21% Robbery outside the home 13% Assault 30% These estimates compare with the ratio of finalized cases to crimes reported by the police of 23% derived from SAPS and NPA data. Not every appearance in court of an accused is preceded by an arrest. A simple summons to court can suffice. The next brief will provide, as far as possible, estimates of the stocks and flows in the model set out in the first brief, leading to an assessment of the efficiency of the components of the criminal justice system.
