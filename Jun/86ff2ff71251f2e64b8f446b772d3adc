HOSPITALÂ MALNUTRITION CASES DOWN SHARPLY IN GAUTENG There has been a sharp reduction in reported malnutrition cases in Gauteng so far this year despite the problems caused by the COVID-19 lockdown. This information was revealed by Gauteng Health MEC Bandile Masuku in an oral reply today to my questions at a virtual sitting of the Gauteng Legislature. According to Masuku, there were 240 malnutrition cases seen at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in March to April last year, as compared to 101 cases for the same three month period this year. Most of these cases are children. This reduction is surprising in view of the increased need for food assistance during the lockdown period. I am concerned that the monitoring of malnutrition is inadequate and that lockdown factors are delaying the presentation of malnutrition cases in hospitals. Nutrition is extremely important for health and should not be neglected during this COVID-19 pandemic. More intensive monitoring is needed to pick up malnutrition cases in the community before they need to be hospitalised. Statement issued by Jack Bloom MPL, DA Gauteng Shadow Health MEC, 2 June 2020
