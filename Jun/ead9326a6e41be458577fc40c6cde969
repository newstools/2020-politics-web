Cancer treatment in Gauteng continues despite Covid-19 Cancer treatment is continuing at the Steve Biko and Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg hospitals despite the Covid-19 pandemic, with few operations deferred or cancelled. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));This is according to Gauteng Health MEC Bandile Masuku in a written reply to my questions in the Gauteng Legislature. Masuku says that no cancer surgery has been cancelled at Steve Biko Hospital since the lockdown was imposed in March, and 16 operations for cancer were delayed at Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Hospital (CMJH) because of a reduction in theatre lists. Both hospitals have not cancelled any chemotherapy appointments. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));I am relieved that cancer treatment is largely continuing as delay would be life-threatening in many cases. I am concerned, however, whether there will be enough ICU beds for cancer surgery when the Covid-19 cases surge and peak in Gauteng. Another concern is the increasingly long wait for prostate cancer treatment at CMJH which is now five years. This has worsened from last year when there were 400 prostate cancer patients waiting for three years. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));We need to ensure that cancer treatment is not compromised in life-threatening cases throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.
