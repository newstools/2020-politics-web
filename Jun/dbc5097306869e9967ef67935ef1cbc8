Service delivery chaos reigns in Tshwane 19 June 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[468,60],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0']));The Democratic Alliance (DA) is outraged at the poor service delivery and continuous power outages that have hit the City of Tshwane since the arrival of the unlawfully imposed administrators. Residents of Wards 6 and 67 in Mamelodi have been left to freeze in the dark for almost a week now and have been burning tyres and placing bricks on the roads in protest as a sign of their frustration and anger at the incessant power cuts. Eersterust, Pretoria East, the Moot and Soshanguve residents have also been without electricity for three days. And while this is going on the administrators are nowhere in sight. DA representatives have consulted with the officials in each of the affected service delivery regions and have been informed that there are currently more than 200 outages throughout the city. Furthermore, the DA has learnt that in some regions there are only two teams to assist the entire region consisting of up to 30 wards during this time of crisis. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));We have also learnt that up to 5 electricity depots have been closed down due to a Covid-19 threat, which is hampering the rollout of services even more. These are clear indications that the city is facing a huge crisis due to the failure of the current administrators, who have been unlawfully forced on the City of Tshwane by the provincial ANC government. Not only are they failing to address these issues, but neither are they communicating with the city residents as to how they are planning to rectify the chaos they are creating. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_5',115,'0','1']));We call on the administrators to come forward and provide the residents and all the stakeholders with full details of the electricity crisis and what plans are being put in place to solve it. We do not want any more of their lies, and these problems can no longer be swept under the carpet. Residents deserve to know what is going on and they deserve better services. The DA representatives will continue to fight for better services for residents during this challenging time. Issued by Randall Williams, DA Tshwane Mayoral Candidate, 19 June 2020
