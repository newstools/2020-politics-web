We send our condolences to the families and loved ones of the deceased at this time. Hospitalisations: A total of 1405 people are currently in hospital in the province. Included in these numbers are the admissions at our two completed temporary hospitals, the Hospital of Hope and the Khayelitsha MSF hospital. The Hospital of Hope has so far admitted a total of 45 people since it opened last week and 15 have already been discharged. The Khayelitsha hospital currently has 15 admissions. Most people who contract COVID-19 will recover without the need for hospitalisation however, a small percentage of people will require hospital care. Our ICU admissions currently account for under 2% of all active cases. The majority of people who become seriously ill have been over the age of 55 or have one or more comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, HIV, and heart, lung and kidney ailments. This is why it is very important that we all work together to help protect the vulnerable. By staying home as much as possible, avoiding gatherings, wearing a mask, washing your hands, and keeping your distance when out in public you can not only prevent getting sick yourself, but you can also protect your loved ones and save lives Statement issued by the Office of the Western Cape Premier, 26 June 2020
