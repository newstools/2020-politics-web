By 31 May 2020, 116 867 clients were paid for the Special COVID-19 SRD Grant. In addition, to date, over 3,5 million were checked to confirm if they are either active SASSA grant recipients, are on the UIF database or receive an NSFAS stipend. “We have received approximately 13 million enquiries/applications about the temporary special COVID-19 SRD grant as at Monday, 25 May 2020. About 6.3 million of these were valid complete applications. The rest were either duplicate applications, incomplete, had inconsistent data, or were just pure enquiries”, said Busisiwe Memela, SASSA CEO.
