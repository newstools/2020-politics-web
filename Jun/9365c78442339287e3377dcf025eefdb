We therefore announced 75 new deaths today, however, not all of these occurred in the past 24 hours. We receive manual confirmation of deaths from the public and private hospitals before the numbers are formally loaded onto our electronic system and there is therefore also a lag between today's number of deaths and the number being reported on our electronic dashboard.  The total number of COVID-19 related deaths now stands at 774 in the province. We send our condolences to the family and loved ones of the deceased at this time. CTICC Hospital of Hope:eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0'])); Tomorrow, the Western Cape Hospital of Hope at the CTICC will admit its first patients as part of a phased opening. The hospital will create an additional 862 intermediate care beds when operating at full capacity. I would like to thank all of the Western Cape Government staff and service providers who have worked tirelessly to ensure that this project could be completed in just four weeks. We wish all of the patients who will be receiving care there a speedy recovery and send our thanks to the healthcare workers who will be working to help them get well. The Western Cape Government is also currently exploring the potential for a second 800 bed hospital at CTICC 2 in order to meet the bed numbers that our updated models anticipate will be required at the peak of infections. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','0']));The fight against COVID-19 is a fight to save lives and while we continue to work to strengthen the healthcare system, we need every single citizen to work to stop the spread of this virus. By staying home whenever possible, and and sticking to the golden rules of handwashing and hygiene, keeping a distance of 1.5 metres between yourself and any other person when in public places and always wearing a clean cloth mask, we can help to slow the spread of this virus. Cloth masks: We note the new advice issued by the World Health Organisation on the use of cloth masks. The organisation now advises that people should wear masks in public places like on public transport and in places where social distancing may be hard such as in grocery shops, schools and in places of worship. In South Africa, wearing of masks when out in public is regulated and we call on all residents to ensure that they are wearing masks, and wearing them correctly. Masks must be clean, and worn correctly, which includes only touching them by the straps when putting them on and taking them off, and sanitising hands before and after this. eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-banner-1','ezslot_5',116,'0','0']));Cloth masks should not be seen as the only line of defense against this virus and must always be used in conjunction with good hygiene, hand washing and social distancing must always be adhered to.
