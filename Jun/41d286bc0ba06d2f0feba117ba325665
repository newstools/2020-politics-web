VBS – Spotlight must fall on ANC and EFF’s involvement 17 June 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[468,60],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_7',112,'0','0']));The FF Plus welcomes the arrest of eight key role players in the VBS fraud saga, which amounted to more than R2 billion, but now action must also be taken against the prominent political figures and officials in the ANC and EFF who allegedly also benefited from the funds that were looted through VBS. During the VBS-related media conference held by the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) earlier today, questions were raised about the involvement of the leader and deputy leader of the EFF, Julius Malema and Floyd Shivambu, and whether action will possibly be taken against them. Vague denials of these two persons and other ANC officials' involvement will not appease the FF Plus or the public and the party insists that any form of involvement in the matter must be uncovered. The FF Plus also demands that all the persons who were responsible for the investments that the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) made in VBS with money from the Government Employee Pension Fund (GEPF) must be held accountable. All those involved at the PIC, including directors, members of the investment committee, the valuation subcommittee and other relevant committees, must be held personally liable for any money that was lost due to investments made in VBS if they were aware of irregularities, but kept silent about it. It is public knowledge that the municipal officials who were implicated in the saga have been on paid leave for months because the disciplinary actions against them have not yet been finalised. So they are in effect getting golden handshakes from the very same communities that are suffering due to their alleged criminal conduct – the disciplinary steps against these persons must be finalised as soon as possible. It is encouraging that the authorities have already seized the assets of some of the persons who were arrested. Adv Shamila Batohi, national director of public prosecutions, and her team of investigators must ensure that the accused are not allowed to continue with their lavish lifestyles using the money and assets that were unlawfully looted from these poor communities and municipalities.
