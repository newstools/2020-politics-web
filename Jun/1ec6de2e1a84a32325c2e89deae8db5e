Vaccinations not adversely affected by Covid-19 in Gauteng 4 June 2020 Vaccinations for children in Gauteng have not been adversely affected by the COVID-19 epidemic. This information was revealed by Gauteng Health MEC Bandile Masuku in an oral reply this week to my questions at a virtual sitting of the Gauteng Legislature. According to Masuku, vaccination coverage for children under one years old was 88% so far this year as compared to 84% the same period last year. For children under five years old the coverage was 78% last year, and increased slightly to 80% so far this year. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));Masuku attributed this to the follow-up by community health workers as part of the Ward Based Outreach Teams. I am encouraged that children are still being vaccinated in large numbers but a few years ago the department prided itself on close to 100% vaccination coverage. This slippage is of concern and needs to be rectified even as we face the COVID-19 challenge. Issued by Jack Bloom, DA Gauteng Shadow Health MEC, 4 June 2020
