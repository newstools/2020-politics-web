Minister Lindiwe Sisulu on investigation of alleged corruption audio 3 June 2020 The Ministry of Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation has been inundated with questions regarding an audio of alleged corruption involving two former and one current members of the National Rapid Response Team (NRRTT) of the Department of Water and Sanitation. In the audio, Mr Thami Ka-Plaatjie and two other individuals who were dismissed last week following allegations that they were using the NRRTT as a vehicle for self-enrichment can be heard discussing a budget of R200 million allocated for the provision of water in Maluti-a-Phofung in the Free State. Minister Sisulu was furnished with the audio a couple of days ago, following reports detailing the alleged corruption by one of the Sunday newspapers. Minister Sisulu has since directed that Advocate Terry Motau investigate the audio as a matter of priority. Adv. Motau was brought in to review cases of historical corruption in the Department of Water and Sanitation. These relate to over R16 billion in fruitless and wasteful expenditure – R1,7 billion of which disappeared and is feared stolen. Adv. Motau will provide guidance on the matter at the conclusion of the investigation into the audio. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));“I have indicated time and again that nobody will be spared in our investigations; corruption is a cancer that is destroying our nation and all our efforts will be directed at fighting it wherever it raises its ugly head,” said Minister Sisulu. Minister Sisulu also encourages members of the public to report any suspicious activities to the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies.
