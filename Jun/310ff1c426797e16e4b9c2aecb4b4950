Premature easing questions entire Covid-19 response by government 18 June 2020 The IFP believes that the decision to further reopen some sectors of the economy based on political considerations and pending court challenges in place of epidemiological data and medical facts, calls into question the entire Covid-19 lockdown response by government. The effects coupled with the levels of uncertainty, deaths and further spreading of Covid-19 due to lockdown alert Level 3 have not been fully monitored and therefore this announcement by President Cyril Ramaphosa is poorly timed and ill-considered. It is unfortunate that our country must acknowledge and recognize that we are fighting a parallel crisis, a global pandemic, an economic recession and the scourge of heinous acts of violence committed against women and children. The lifting of the restrictions is premature as many other sectors are left in the lurch and are fighting for survival on the frontlines as school classrooms are not certain of remaining open, hospital beds are filling up to capacity and testing, tracing and tracking of the coronavirus is not up to speed. We therefore caution government of any further reopening and easing mechanisms to avoid costing our country many dear lives. The IFP reiterates our call on South Africans to remain extremely cautious, vigilant, practice precautionary health measures, maintain social and physical distancing and adhere to the lockdown regulations.
