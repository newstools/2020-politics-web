EFF statement on the VBS arrests 17 June 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));The Economic Freedom Fighters welcomes the arrest of all people who are accused of acts of corruption and criminality that relates to the VBS Mutual Bank. We welcome these arrests because an opportunity will be presented in neutral Courts of Law to present hard facts and evidence, thereby removing the media campaign and slander that has been ongoing since the release of the South African Reserve Bank report on improprieties in the Bank. We further welcome the commitment by the DPCI that no stone will be left unturned in conducting these investigations and that everyone involved in the wrong will be held accountable. The leadership of the EFF reaffirms its statements and articulations that despite the so many factional and politically influenced allegations against its leadership, there is no wrongdoing or criminal activity committed by its leaders. We will closely monitor and developments and believe that the process underway way will be conducted in a free and fair manner so that justice prevails and that the legal principle of "innocent until proven guilty" is followed both in letter and in spirit.
