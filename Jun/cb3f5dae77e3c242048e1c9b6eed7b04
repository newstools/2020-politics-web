TLU SA objects to government’s work on Sunday  1 June 2020 TLU SA has a serious objection to the government’s new trend of announcing important information on Sundays. “We are very disappointed in the government’s insistence to host media conferences and meetings around COVID-19 on Sundays,” says Mr Louis Meintjes, the president of TLU SA. “President Ramaphosa goes to the trouble of announcing a day of prayer, but then the government breaks the Sabbath on that very same day. The Word of God is very clear about Sundays. How can we expect the blessing of God Almighty if the government insists on continuing on this purposefully wrong road?” TLU SA is very proud of being a Christian organisation which believes that God Almighty is in control. “The power of prayer is probably more important at the moment than some of the ridiculous and senseless regulations,” says MrMeintjes. “The government must stop standing in the way of the faithful who want to praise God Almighty – on Sundays – and want to treat the day as holy.”eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0'])); Issued by Louis Meintjes, President TLU SA, 1 June 2020
