Mr President, do the right thing and fire Minister Zulu The Democratic Alliance (DA) calls on President Cyril Ramaphosa to fire the Minister of Social Development, Lindiwe Zulu. The Minister has reportedly stated recently that she never expected the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic would have such a crippling impact on the poor.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0'])); This has not been the first time the Minister has put her foot in her mouth during the pandemic. During the early stages of the lockdown, Minister Zulu posted on Instagram that she had a hard time staying at home and that the “[Coronavirus] must go away”. Minister Zulu has proven that she is completely out of touch with the realities that poor and vulnerable South Africans face and that she is clearly incapable of running the Department of Social Development (DSD). The DSD and the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) have performed dismally during this time of crisis. Their mandate is to provide social relief during a disaster and to manage and distribute relief. However, the DSD and SASSA’s response has been wholly inadequate and they have failed at every turn.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0'])); 1. SASSA completely fumbled food relief for the poor, with reports of the entire food parcel distribution and allocation process being politicized. 2. Minister Zulu attempted to criminalize charity during the lockdown, by banning NGOs and Good Samaritans from providing food parcels. 3. The payment of the R350 Relief of Distress Grant has been mired by technical glitches and chronic delays.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0'])); 4. There have been several complaints from needy South Africans who have applied for this grant, that their applications have been rejected on the basis that they have other incomes. 5. The SASSA hotline is reportedly offline and desperate South Africans are unable to access information and clarity at this time. 6. Vulnerable South Africans, especially the elderly, have to wait hours in the cold outside of SASSA offices for assistance because the entity is currently only working at 30% capacity.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','0'])); The Minister, her department and SASSA have not only buckled under pressure since the start of the lockdown, they have proven that they are incapable of providing relief to the poor and vulnerable. Minister Zulu is not fit for purpose and she has shown nothing but disdain for the poor and vulnerable. Her apologies are hollow and do not mean anything for the millions of South Africans whose dignity she has disregarded. The DA calls on President Ramaphosa to do the right thing and remove Minister Zulu from office.
