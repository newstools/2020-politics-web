AfriForum, Adv. Gerrie Nel represent Botswana government in money-laundering and fraud case 23 June 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[468,60],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));AfriForum today announced that its Private Prosecution Unit, under the leadership of Adv. Gerrie Nel, has officially been appointed by the Botswana government to represent this government in a high-profile money-laundering and fraud case, in which businesswoman Bridgette Motsepe-Radebe is implicated. Motsepe-Radebe is the sister-in-law of President Cyril Ramaphosa and wife of Jeff Radebe. Adv. Nel and Adv. Phyllis Vorster of AfriForum’s Private Prosecution Unit were officially appointed by Adv. Stephen Tiroyakgosi, Botswana’s Director of Public Prosecution (DPP), to represent the Republic of Botswana. The mandate in this case is to facilitate the Botswana government’s request for mutual legal assistance in the Bank of Botswana fraud and money-laundering matter. The DPP in Botswana has already submitted a request for mutual legal assistance on 25 September 2019 to the Department of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO), but this request has since conveniently vanished. This follows after Motsepe-Radebe was identified as a cosignatory of at least two bank accounts (one of which was an Absa and the other a Nedbank account) holding some of the more than $10 billion (R150 billion) allegedly stolen from the Botswana government to finance a “coup” before the national election in this country. There are also accusations against Motsepe-Radebe that she laundered millions of Botswana Pulas through Avante Security Services to sponsor the opposition candidate of Mokgweetsi Eric Keabetswe Masisi, President of Botswana. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_3',113,'0','1']));“The fact that DIRCO failed to give any feedback to the DPP of Botswana over nine months indicates that the South African government is unwilling to assist our client with their request. We will intervene and ensure that our client receives the necessary cooperation from the South African government to ensure that justice prevails,” says Adv. Nel. “It is a privilege for AfriForum to officially work together with the Botswana government. It is necessary for us as fellow Africans who want to help ensure that our continent is successful, to do everything in our power to eradicate fraud and money-laundering. Our continent and sub-continent have immense potential that is being handicapped by corrupt elite. AfriForum is committed to strengthening the Botswana government’s hand in this necessary fight against corruption,” says Kallie Kriel, CEO of AfriForum.
