This means that in some instances, cases could be allocated to the wrong sub-districts. We are working with the sub-districts to clean and verify the data and where errors are picked up locally, cases will be re-allocated to the correct areas. More data is available here: https://coronavirus.westerncape.gov.za/covid-19-dashboard The Western Cape has recorded an additional 26 deaths, bringing the total number of COVID-19 related deaths in the province to 1399. We send our condolences to their families and friends at this time. Red Dot Taxi Service Update:eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_5',115,'0','1'])); The Red Dot Taxi Service, implemented by the Departments of Transport and Public Works and Health as part of our hotspot strategy, has since its launch on 18 May, transported approximately 12000 healthcare workers working at 15 healthcare facilities, over a distance of 150 000 km. The Western Cape Government has partnered with the local taxi industry to create a fleet of almost 200 Red Dot taxis. The service provides safe transport home for an average of 450 healthcare workers each evening. The taxis observe strict hygiene and social distancing protocols, which include a screen between the driver and passengers, sanitizing of the vehicle between each trip, compulsory wearing of masks and only carrying half of the vehicle capacity. The Red Dot taxis also transport people to and from the Western Cape Government's isolation and quarantine facilities. Since launching at the end of May, this service has transported approximately 1 1100 people. Our healthcare workers are incredibly important in the fight against COVID-19 and this service is one additional way in which we are working to protect them. We can also help to reduce the spread of the virus by ensuring that people traveling to our isolation and quarantine facilities, do so in designated vehicles. Courage on the frontlines:eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-banner-1','ezslot_6',116,'0','0'])); Today, I would  like to acknowledge the healthcare workers and staff of Ward C13 at Groote Schuur Hospital. This team of high care staff had to care for one of their own colleagues, Sister June Anita Richards, who became ill after contracting COVID-19. Sister Richards was admitted to the very same high care ward she has worked in for 20 years, earlier this month, where she was treated using high flow nasal oxygen which was recently introduced as an alternative to ventilation at the hospital. Sister Richards was discharged from hospital last week. We wish her well on her road to full recovery and thank all of the doctors, nurses and hospital staff who contributed to her recovery. The team of C13 are among thousands of heroes who are fighting COVID-19 on the front lines. I would also like to thank all of the healthcare workers and hospital staff who have played such a major role in the province's response to COVID-19, whose courage, commitment and care are helping to save lives. On behalf of the Western Cape Government and the residents of this province, I thank you all for your service. Preparing for the peak: Some epidemiological models, including the National Covid-19 Epi Model (NCEM) which is relied on by the national government for forecasting, have estimated that the province will experience its peak soon. While we cannot pinpoint the exact date at which we will reach this peak, we are experiencing increased pressure in our hospitals. At the same time, the economy is opening up further, with personal care services re-opening this weekend and other sectors expected to open soon. Now is therefore the time to be extra vigilant to slow the spread. Precautions you can take to protect yourself and your loved ones: Regular handwashing and hygiene measures which include coughing into your elbow or a tissue, regular cleaning of surfaces at home or at work, and not touching your face. Stay at home whenever possible. Do not go to places where groups of people gather unless necessary. Do not visit family or friends to socialise as this could put everyone at risk. Always keeping a distance of at least 1.5 metres between yourself and any other person when you are not at home. This includes in the workplace, in queues, on public transport or anywhere where people gather. Wearing a clean, cloth mask whenever you leave home. Wearing your mask correctly and at all times, not only protects you but can prevent you from making others sick. Stay at home if you feel sick. Seek medical care if you experience shortness of breath If you are over the age of 55 or you have an underlying illness, you are at higher risk of becoming seriously ill or dying. It is therefore important that you take extra precautions and stay home wherever possible. Those who are healthy should assist those at higher risk with tasks like shopping or errands that require them to leave the house. Western Cape Office of the Premier, 21 June 2020
