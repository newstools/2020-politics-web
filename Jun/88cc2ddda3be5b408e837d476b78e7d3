Gauteng Human Settlements Department has no plan to de-densify Gauteng’s informal settlements and townships to curb the spread of Covid-19 4 June 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng is dismayed that the Gauteng Department of Human Settlements does not have a plan for the de-densification of people living in Gauteng’s informal settlements and townships to stem the spread of the Covid-19. This was revealed by the Gauteng Department of Human Settlements and Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (COGTA) MEC, Lebogang Maile while responding to the DA’s oral questions during the Gauteng Provincial Legislature’s (GPL) virtual sitting. MEC Maile failed to indicate if there is any de-densification plan and appeared to confuse the National Emergency Plan with the Informal Settlement Formalization Plan. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));Despite being pressed to respond to the question MEC Maile failed to provide details of what steps have been taken to counter the spread of the virus or give any detail of a de-densification plan or how such a plan will be implemented in anticipation of the peak of the Coronavirus. He could not provide any projection as to how many units would be required during the peak of the virus. The MEC’s response indicates that this department is in disarray with no effective de-densification plan to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic which is aggravated by the department’s repetitive under performance and failure to spend its allocated budget. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));Failure to de-densify our informal settlements and townships will unfortunately have a detrimental effect in countering the spread of the Coronavirus in our informal settlements and townships across the province. Gauteng residents living in informal settlements and townships have long waited for the de-densification process. However, under the ANC government this is yet another empty promise. The DA will continue to put pressure on MEC Maile to provide a plan on how our overcrowded townships and informal settlements will be de-densified.
