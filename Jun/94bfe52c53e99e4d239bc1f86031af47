This means that in some instances, cases could be allocated to the wrong sub-districts. We are working with the sub-districts to clean and verify the data and where errors are picked up locally, cases will be re-allocated to the correct areas. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));More data is available here: https://coronavirus.westerncape.gov.za/covid-19-dashboard The Western Cape has recorded an additional 76 deaths, bringing the total number of COVID-19 related deaths in the province to 1500.

This data is approximately 85% complete is approximately 80-85% accurate. We release this data in the interests of transparency and to give residents a picture of how the virus is progressing in the areas in which they live. This information should be used by residents to arm themselves with knowledge and should not be used to cause fear, or stigma. Anyone can get infected by Covid-19 and we must remember to be kind and compassionate to those who fall ill. Unemployment statistics: The StatsSA Quarterly Labour Force  survey, released today, shows that unemployment in South Africa has reached over 30 percent, with 38 000 jobs lost in the country in the first quarter of this year. While the Western Cape did record the lowest unemployment rate of 20.9% in the country, we must bear in mind that these statistics only cover the period January to March, and do not include the extended lock down period which has had a major impact on businesses and jobs in the Western Cape and across the country. We are facing a serious humanitarian crisis as more and more people lose their jobs. This is why it is important that the economy be allowed to re-open in the safest way possible. Preserving people's jobs and livelihoods must be carefully balanced with our need to control the spread of the coronavirus. Businesses who are operating must be doing so safely, with the utmost care for their staff and their clientele. This includes implementing strict hygiene and sanitation, and ensuring that staff and customers are able to practice social distancing. eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-banner-1','ezslot_6',116,'0','0']));COVID-19 is going to be with us for many months to come, and we will need to be careful even after the country has reached its peak. Putting extra measures in place now will help to protect your business, your staff and your customers in the long run. The Western Cape is working hard to support business so that this happens.
