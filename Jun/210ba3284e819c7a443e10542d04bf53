ECONOMIC FREEDOM FIGHTERS STATEMENT ON THE 65TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FREEDOM CHARTER. Friday, 26 June 2020 The Economic Freedom Fighters marks the 65th Anniversary of the adoption of the Freedom Charter. The Freedom Charter was adopted on the 26th of June 1955 as the most explicit expression and articulation of black people's political. social and economic aspirations.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0'])); We commemorate the 65th Anniversary of the Freedom Charter because the EFF Founding Manifesto says, "The EFF draws inspiration from the radical, working-class interpretation of the Freedom Charter. because, since its adoption in 1955, there have been various meanings given to the Freedom Charter. The EFF's interpretation of the Freedom Charter is one which says South Africa indeed belongs to all who live in it, and ownership of South Africa's economic resources and access to opportunities should reflect that indeed South Africa belongs to all who live in it. The EFF's interpretation of the Freedom Charter is that which says the transfer of mineral wealth beneath the soil, monopoly industries and banks means nationalisation of mines, banks and monopoly industries. The EFF's interpretation of the Freedom Charter also accepts that while the state is in command and control of the commanding heights of South Africa's economy, "people shall have equal rights to trade where they choose, to manufacture and to enter all trades, crafts and professions", meaning that there will never be wholesale nationalisation and state control of every sector of South Africa's economy. Nationalisation of strategic sectors and assets will be blended with a strong industrial policy to support social and economic development.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0'])); Amongst its Freedom Clarion Calls, the Freedom Charter says: All people shall be entitled to take part in the administration of the country: The rights of the people shall be the same, regardless of race, colour or sex;eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0'])); The national wealth of our country, the heritage of all South Africans, shall be restored to the people; The mineral wealth beneath the soil, the banks and monopoly industry shall be transferred to the ownership of the people as a whole; Restrictions of land ownership on a racial basis shall be ended, and all the land re-divided amongst those who work it, to banish famine and land hunger;eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_5',115,'0','1'])); The state shall help the peasants with implements, seed, tractors and dams to save the soil and assist the tillers; All shall have the right to occupy land wherever they choose; The courts shall be representative of all the people; Imprisonment shall be only for serious crimes against the people and shall aim at reÂ­education, not vengeance; The law shall guarantee to all their right to speak, to organise, to meet together, to publish, to preach, to worship and to educate their children;eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-banner-1','ezslot_6',116,'0','0'])); All who work shall be free to form trade unions, to elect their officers and to make wage agreements with their employers; The aim of education shall be to teach the youth to love their people and their culture, to honour human brotherhood, liberty and peace; Education shall be free, compulsory, universal and equal for all children; Higher education and technical training shall be opened to all by means of state allowances and scholarships awarded on the basis of merit; Adult illiteracy shall be ended by a mass state education plan; All people shall have the right to live where they choose, to be decently housed, and to bring up their families in comfort and security: Unused housing space to be made available to the people: The right of all the peoples of Africa to independence and self-government shall be recognised and shall be the basis of close co-operation. We highlight these freedom clarion calls because these inspired many generations in the struggle against colonialism and apartheid. The apartheid regime increased its brutality and violence against black people after the freedom charter adoption. We also highlight these freedom charter clarion calls because despite having fought under the banner of the freedom charter, the current government is not guided by its commitments. The ruling party has abandoned the Freedom Charter and does not uphold its values, principles and commitments. We, as the generation of Economic Freedom Fighters. will fight for the attainment of all Freedom Charter objectives. Together with the Founding Manifesto, the Freedom Charter constitutes the core of our political programme. THESE FREEDOMS WE WILL FIGHT FOR. SIDE BY SIDE, THROUGHOUT OUR LIVES, UNTIL WE HAVE WON OUR (ECONOMIC) LIBERTY. Issued by the EFF, 26 June 2020
