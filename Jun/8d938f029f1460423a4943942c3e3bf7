We send our condolences to the families and loved ones of the deceased at this time. Hospital of Hope: The first patient to be admitted to the Hospital of Hope today was a 75 year old man from Mitchell's Plain who was admitted this afternoon. Ten patients, including five men and five women will be admitted today. The 75 year old man was the oldest patient, while the youngest is a 31 year old man from Phillipi. The other patients are from Gugulethu, Crossroads, Portlands, Lenteguer, Sea Ridge Park, Mandaly, Samora and Rocklands. All ten patients are in recovery and meet the intermediate care admission criteria. We wish them well on their path to good health. Vulnerable groups: eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','0']));The Western Cape Government is taking extra steps to assist vulnerable people during the COVID-19 pandemic. People over the age of 55, and those with underlying illnesses like diabetes, hypertension, and heart and lung disorders are most at risk of becoming seriously ill or dying. The Department of Social Development in the province is providing additional support to old aged homes to help fight COVID-19. This support includes testing and screening, and specilaised training in infection prevention. An additional R1.755 million in funding has also been allocated to old aged homes for the fight against COVID-19.  We have also made 15 00 masks available to homes across the province and provided 5000 face shields to over 100 homes. The Western Cape Government’s Department of Health still continues to deliver chronic medication to stable patients at their homes so that they do not have to leave home to fetch them at healthcare facilities. The Department has also prioritized healthcare workers, the elderly and chronic patients for the flu vaccine, to ensure that their immune systems are not further compromised by contracting the flu. Our risk adjusted testing strategy also ensures that while the testing backlog persists, tests should be reserved for those who are experiencing symptoms and who need tests most: healthcare workers, people in hospital, those over the age of 55, and those with co-morbidities.
