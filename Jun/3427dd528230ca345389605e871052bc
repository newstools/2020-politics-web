Imminent dissolution of Bar Council necessitates alternative for advocates 3 June 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));The Occupational Guild for Law Professionals and the Association of Lawyers for Afrikaans noted with concern the financial uncertainties surrounding the survival of the Pretoria Bar Council in its present format. Henru Kruger, sector head for professional services at Solidarity, explains: “The Pretoria Bar Council has a remarkable and exceptional history, surviving two world wars and political turmoil. The Bar has a long history and a number of traditions that have been part of it for many years. One of those traditions is that members are always ready to assist another member, and it is not unusual for a junior member of the Bar to approach a senior member for advice on dealing with any problem he or she may have encountered in practice. Therefore, becoming a member of the Bar opens a door for an emergent advocate to the collective knowledge, wisdom, and experience of all the members of the Bar. Kruger explains that, historically, the Bar has been the institution by which advocates have regulated their own profession. Unfortunately though, under the new Legal Practice Act no 28 of 2014 this function has, to a large extent, been taken over by a statutory body, namely the Legal Practice Council. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));“The Bar itself, however, still maintains professional integrity and a strict ethical code of conduct, a code all advocates must adhere to. This is an incredibly powerful example of a profession that is regulated from the bottom up by those active in the profession. The outstanding results speak for themselves,” Kruger said. According to the guild and the association, it is imperative that advocates be able to associate and regulate themselves of their own accord by supporting each other, maintaining standards, and imparting knowledge and sharing wisdom and experience with newcomers. “The Occupational Guild for Law Professionals is a professional lawyers’ community that ensures that its members can practice in a free, safe and prosperous way. For this reason, the guild will endeavour to assist advocates so that they can build on the proud history of the advocacy and to ensure a certain future for advocates,” Kruger concluded.
