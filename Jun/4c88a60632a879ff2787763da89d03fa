GBV: DA calls on MEC to investigate low conviction rate  8 June 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng is deeply concerned that despite the high number of gender-based violence cases opened, and arrests made between 1 March to 30 April 2020, there is a low conviction rate. This was revealed by the Gauteng MEC for Community Safety, Faith Mazibuko in a written reply to the DA’s questions in the Gauteng Provincial Legislature (GPL). According to MEC Mazibuko, from 1 March to 30 April 2020, 5 082 cases of gender-based violence have been opened at police stations across Gauteng. Of these cases opened only 3 373 arrests have been made with 204 resulting in convictions. It is very worrying that there is a low conviction rate which clearly indicates that its either the justice system that is failing our people, or the police are failing to properly investigate these cases. The lack of adequate investigation of gender-based violence cases has resulted in many cases being taken off the court roll due to a lack of sufficient evidence that can lead to prosecution. It is high time that cases of gender-based violence are prioritised to ensure justice for the victims. The DA calls on MEC Mazibuko to investigate why there is such a low conviction rate on gender-based violence cases to ensure that the victims get the justice they deserve.
