Tshwane rates clearance process collapses under illegitimate ANC administrators 15 June 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) is dismayed to have learned that the African National Congress (ANC) unlawfully imposed City of Tshwane administrators have lost control of the rates clearance process. This has led to the gradual collapse in the process of the issuing of rates clearance certificates. Estate agents and lawyers have been attempting to engage with the city to sort out the online process but there has been no response from the administrators. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));DA representatives in the city are receiving daily complaints about what appears to be a long-lasting backlog due to the inability to ensure that this service continues effectively. There is a growing list of properties in the city that cannot be legally sold because the property owners have not been able to source their rates clearance certificates from the city administration. This is momentously disruptive to individuals who are currently looking to buy or sell property as they have been trapped in an ineffective and unresponsive bureaucratic process. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));It is clear that the administrators have failed to prepare to carry on this vital aspect of city business in the face of the Covid-19 crisis. The real estate sector and conveyancers around the city are now unable to do their work because this basic administrative process is no longer working which is threatening their businesses and livelihoods. This is bound to cause immense delays in housing transfers and disrupt the lives of residents across the city. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','0']));This debacle is added to the litany of failures by the ANC administrators since they were unlawfully imposed in the city. The collapse of rate clearance certificate processes can now be included alongside all the customer care centres which are still closed and the city planning and building control offices which are unresponsive.
