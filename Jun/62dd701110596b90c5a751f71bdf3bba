EFF statement on Taxi Associations and the relief fund 21 June 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[468,60],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0']));The EFF supports the demand put by the Taxi Associations for more relief funds than what the government has put on the table. We agree that R5000 per taxi is not and will never be enough. Each taxi must be given at least R20 000 as a relief fund. In the entire transport system in our country, the taxi industry is the best mechanism of wealth distribution. It is at the closest to the lowest ranks of our economic system as a whole. The money in the hands of taxi drivers will surely be spent on the taxi industry ecosystem, which includes informal traders around taxi ranks. This will benefit millions of families who will have actual buying power, boost demand and lead to more trade in the economy. We also call on a general ban on repossession of taxis by the South African banking industry. All taxis must be given an interest-free payment holiday for the entire year so that they can recover from economic strife. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0']));The taxi industry is an essential part of the country's fight against COVID-19. Even if the country should return to lockdown level 5, taxis will still be central to the transportation of essential workers. In fact, at some point, when COVID-19 reaches its peak, they will have to be integrated medical emergency services to help in the fight against COVID-19. We call on other small businesses to join the taxi strike tomorrow in demand of benefits from the Solidarity Fund. The Solidarity Relief funds must trickle down, and relieve the bottom. downtrodden businesses, particularly in black communities that never receive any help from white-dominated and owned banks Issued by Vuyani Pambo, National Spokesperson, EFF, 21 June 2020eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));
