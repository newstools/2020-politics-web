Lesufi admits that poor schools cause influx of learners to schools that offer better quality education 20 June 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[468,60],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0']));The MEC for Education in Gauteng, Panyaza Lesufi, indicated during the Legislature's debate on the education budget that there are enough schools in the province, but because some schools offer substandard education, parents are taking their children to schools offering good quality education. The FF Plus considers this statement misleading as there are numerous studies indicating that there are not enough schools in Gauteng. Even the Legislature's own Education Committee confirmed in its report that the planned infrastructure projects are not progressing as they should and the Committee chairperson offered a strong argument on the matter during the debate. But Lesufi simply ignored it and he also made no attempt whatsoever to explain why he is not doing anything to empower the substandard schools. Therefore, his admission is actually an accusation against himself and his Department. So, it is Lesufi's fault that black children have to be transported great distances so that they can attend good schools offering quality education. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0']));True to Lesufi's obsession with racism, he linked the FF Plus's justified view that there is a lack of proper school infrastructure with Afrikaans schools' unwillingness to accommodate black learners â€“ a statement that is void of all truth. There exist no public schools that exclude learners based on their race and as always, Lesufi is confusing the concepts of race and Afrikaans. Lesufi simply refuses to accept the fact that the broader Afrikaans community consists of black, brown and white people and protecting Afrikaans schools does not equal racism. Lesufi once again vented his spleen during his speech and implied that all white people are racists based on the Black Lives Matter movement and the events surrounding it. It only confirms that he is biased towards the Afrikaans community. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));The FF Plus condemns with contempt Lesufi's unfounded allegations and cautions him to keep his prejudice in check when it comes to performing the duties of his office. The FF Plus will not tolerate the victimisation of the Afrikaans community. Issued by Anton Alberts, FF Plus national chairperson and MPL: Gauteng, 20 June 2020
