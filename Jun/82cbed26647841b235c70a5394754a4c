Personal Care Services: Minister Dlamini-Zuma fails to comply with timeline for filing papers before the Court  12 June 2020eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0'])); The Democratic Alliance (DA) notes the order issued by Western Cape High Court Judge, Justice Mark Sher, postponing the matter of the ban on hairdressers and personal care services under the level 3 lockdown to Monday, 22 June 2020, for it to be heard before a Full Bench of the Court. This, after Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma failed to file opposing papers. The government will also be given an opportunity to consider reopening the sector, for which a decision may be taken on Wednesday, 17 June 2020 when Cabinet meets. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));The DA sincerely hopes that Cabinet puts the people of the industry first and end their economic suffering. If Minister Dlamini-Zuma and Cabinet does not do so, they would then be forced to provide these reasons under oath. There has been a steadfast refusal by Minister Dlamini-Zuma to open up the personal care industry, let alone meet her own self-imposed deadlines to do so. The Court has ordered the Minister to file and go on record if the government does not open the sector on Wednesday. There is now a clear path towards opening up the industry which includes hairdressers, beauticians, and tattoo artists. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));Minister Dlamini-Zuma has shown a callous disregard for the livelihoods of too many South Africans who have lost so much during this lockdown. The DA will ensure that the Minister is held to account for her inaction and delay in assisting the personal care industry as well as ensuring the government now meets these agreed-upon timelines.
