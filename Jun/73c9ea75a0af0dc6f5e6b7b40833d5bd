We send our condolences to the families and loved ones of the deceased at this time. Alcohol related trauma:eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0'])); A number of our hospitals have seen a significant spike in trauma cases linked to alcohol use since the sale of alcohol was unbanned on 1 June. This is extremely concerning to us as the healthcare system is already under pressure as a result of COVID-19. Since yesterday there have been numerous rumours that alcohol will be banned again. The Western Cape has not made any announcements to this effect, and we have not received any indication from the national government that this is planned. However, I want to be very clear with the people of the Western Cape: alcohol abuse is taking away hospital beds and care from people who need them during this very serious pandemic. Your grandmother, brother or sister could become ill with COVID-19 and require a hospital bed. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','0']));Every single one of us has a role to play in making sure our healthcare system has the capacity to respond – please drink responsibly and play your part. If this doesn’t happen, we will have no choice but to explore alternative steps to ensure that this happens. Groote Schuur testing and triage centre: Another of the Western Cape Government’s testing and triage centres was opened at Groote Schuur today. This site, one of 18 in the first phase, will provide a dedicated space to screen, triage and test patients presenting to Groote Schuur. These centres help to ease the pressure on our hospital emergency care centres, while also separating testing and triaging from the rest of the hospital patients. The province has now also begun phase two of this project, which will create 14 new temporary testing and triage sites in the metro, and an additional 20 in our non-metro areas.
