Commuters across Gauteng are being affected equally. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));Gauteng East: 106 daily train trips have been reduced to 36 (34%) leaving the 285 375 daily commuters with no trains between Daveyton – Dunswart, Germiston – Johannesburg, Elandsfontein – Germiston – Johannesburg and Germiston – Kwesine Gauteng West: 306 daily train trips have been reduced to 100 (33%), leaving their 230 654 daily commuters with no trains between Vereeniging via Midway, Midway – Oberholzer, New Canada – George Goch as well as no train departing from Faraday and Westgate stations Gauteng North: 388 daily train trips  have also been reduced to 79 (20%), leaving their 363 541 daily commuters with no train services between Mabopane – Pretoria, De Wildt – Pretoria,  Saulsville – Pretoria and with only 10 trips between Pretoria and Johannesburg on a daily basis. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','0']));The vandalism has been targeted at Conventional and Modern Signalling System; Signals and Train Detection Cables including Battery Banks at Signalling Equipment Rooms; Multiple spans of Contact and Catenary wire Overhead Track Equipment (OHTE) and Transformers; Rectifiers and various components at substations. Due to the vastly reduced number of train services, trains that are still operating, have become overcrowded to such an extent it is now common cause to see commuters hanging from the sides of the train or even sitting on top of the train. This poses a huge risk to the safety of commuters as they can be hit by oncoming trains or get electrocuted by the 3000-volt dc overhead. Hundreds of thousands of ordinary South Africans rely on affordable and reliable transportation to get to and from work and to seek work, by not having a reliable train service, people are being forced to use other modes of transport at an increase cost to their household budget. The government needs to rescue the situation before we have no train service at all. Issued by Mike Waters, DA Member of Parliament, 15 June 2020
