Basic Education urges communities to respect Coronavirus COVID-19 safety protocols 23 June 2020 The Department of Basic Education is working together with the Department of Health to support the learners, educators and parents affected by the coronavirus in the Eastern Cape. This after 204 learners and hostel assistants tested positive for COVID-19 at Makaula Senior Secondary School in KwaBhaca. As a result the Eastern Cape Department of Health has deployed a team of doctors and tracers to the school. The confirmed cases were picked up as a result of the stringent measures put in place in all schools to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Since schools reopened three weeks under the COVID-19 environment many cases have been picked up in schools as a direct result of the safety requirements that are being implemented. Schools have been urged to follow the Standard Operating Procedures to ensure that appropriate measures are applied to assist all those infected and affected by the virus. Basic Education Minister Mrs Angie Motshekga said the cases being reported in schools show that many people already had the virus but they didn’t know it until they were screened and identified. “We will continue to work hard in schools to make sure that we protect our learners, teachers and employees within schools. It is important to work together to ensure that we beat the virus,” she said.  The Department is working hard to make sure that all schools are COVID-19 compliant before it can receive learners. “What is also important is to ensure that even during schools hours and beyond we stick to the basic requirements of wearing the mask, sanitize, wash hands and keep physical distancing”, Minister Motshekga. She urged members of the community to desist from visiting schools as that also increased the risk for more infections. Issued by Elijah Mhlanga on behalf of Department of Education, 23 June 2020
