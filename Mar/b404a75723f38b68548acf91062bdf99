They include trauma counselling, integration and re-unification of persons who have been isolated or quarantined to mitigate stigmatisation. "We understand the huge inconvenience this will bring to parents or caregivers throughout the country because Early Childhood Development centres are safe places of care - in addition to education, children also receive protection, healthcare and nutrition. The protection of our children should remain uppermost during this period," said Zulu. Zulu, who is part of the inter-ministerial committee tasked with tackling the Covid-19 pandemic, said working with the Department of Health and other key stakeholders must be in the forefront of national efforts to contain the further spread of the virus. "Our efforts will be directed at ensuring we protect the most vulnerable - they will continue to require our services at this difficult time. While we do so, we must take all necessary precautionary measures to protect our staff and our clients, especially at access points in order to contain the spread of this contagious virus and to slow its spread," said Zulu. She further urged all facilities to adhere to Occupation Health and Safety guidelines and to ensure that basic protective measures against the virus were provided. "There is no doubt that the spread of Covid-19 will exacerbate the vulnerability of poor households and that it is likely to increase the demand for social services in the form of social grants, food relief and psycho-social services for affected individuals and families," said Zulu.
