Court dispute over charges against CEO of Far East Rand Hospital 12 March 2020 The Gauteng Health Department is embroiled in a legal battle to take disciplinary action against Dr Zachariah Mathaba, the CEO of the Far East Rand Hospital, who was allegedly grossly dishonest for falsely claiming overtime pay for two years. This was revealed yesterday by Gauteng Health MEC Bandile Masuku in an oral reply to my questions in the Gauteng Legislature. Dr Mathaba was first charged on 7 January last year when he was working at the ThelleMogoerane Hospital. According to Masuku, he won an urgent application in the Labour Court against his suspension, and the Department is now legally challenging this. Meanwhile, Mathaba was appointed as the new CEO of Far East Rand Hospital in November last year despite the cloud hanging over his head. Masuku says that this appointment went ahead as the charges against him were not finalized. It is hugely unsatisfactory that this matter has dragged on and not been resolved earlier. Masuku concedes that it is a “difficult situation” and he is also awaiting a report from the Public Service Commission concerning more information in this matter. This case highlights the Department’s generally poor handling of labour relations. All disciplinary cases should be professionally handled to ensure a speedy resolution.
