Makhura's roadshow backfires dismally 12 March 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));The Democratic Alliance (DA) has noted the roadshow using taxpayers' money to host a propaganda war, by the Premier and his cabinet. It has become evident that these meetings have turned into ANC rallies where Makhura and his cabinet waste provincial government money to mislead the public regarding Tshwane, instead of focusing on municipal service delivery issues in the province as a whole. Community members flocked to the venues to address their own personal issues relating to their ANC ward councillors, Eskom, jobs, and other empty promises that were made by the ANC at a provincial level. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));Its important to see these meetings for what they are. It’s not about putting the people first, but rather an attempt by the Premier and his cabinet to get a mandate from structures within the ANC to continue with their political games with the aim of getting their hands on the coffers of the financially stable Tshwane in the run-up to the 2021 local government elections. Once again, residents are being used as a means to an end. The DA and the residents of Tshwane are tired of the ongoing political games and call on the Premier to stop the politicking and rather focus on service delivery failures across Gauteng, of which there are many. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));If the Premier is serious about putting the people first, then he should escort his MECs to Emfuleni, Mogale, Sedibeng and Ekurhuleni to address the collapsed services in these areas.
