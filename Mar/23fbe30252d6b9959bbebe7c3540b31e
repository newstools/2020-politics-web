While SADTU panders to alliance partners, the DA is fighting to save pension funds 10 March 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));SADTU is accusing the Democratic Alliance (DA) of "trying to be an instant representative of workers" following our decision to consult our lawyers on our legal options to stop the ANC government from using pension funds to bail out Eskom. The truth is that the DA is not trying to represent workers; we do represent them. What makes SADTU's allegations especially ironic, is that the ones who should represent workers, namely the unions, are failing dismally by entertaining this mad idea. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));While SADTU is pandering to the narrow interests of tripartite alliance politics, the DA will continue to champion workers' rights. We will not sit by idly as the pension funds of public servants are in danger of being invested in an entity that cannot be saved. It is, however, not only the pension funds of public servants that are at risk. President Cyril Ramaphosa, last week, stated that "[even] private pension funds, we would like them to also put their money into Eskom". eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));The DA will explore every possible avenue to oppose the government and trade unions' bid to use South Africans' pension funds to bail out Eskom, knowing very well that the money will never be recovered. Unlike what SADTU would like the public to believe, the DA's fight to protect pension funds and to break Eskom's monopoly over the electricity sector is not for the "elite". Our fight is to ensure that government gives power to the people - by breaking Eskom's grip; bringing on board independent power producers; stabilizing the grid and reducing the price of electricity for all.
