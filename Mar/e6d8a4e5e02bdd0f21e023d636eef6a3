DA calls on MEC Maile to provide clarity on Lesedi’s Municipal Manager position 25 March 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng is calling on the Gauteng MEC for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (COGTA), Lebogang Maile to provide clarity on the position of the Lesedi Municipal Manager. The DA notes that the position of the Lesedi Municipal Manager was advertised in the City Press newspaper last week in which the closing date for applications was given as the is 26 March 2020. Considering the fact that the MEC approved the appointment of the current Acting Municipal Manager, Gugu Thimane until the next municipal elections, the advertisement of the Municipal Manager position raises questions. The DA has been reliably informed that the Speaker of the Lesedi Council has called a Special Council Meeting scheduled for tomorrow to appoint another Acting Municipal Manager. This is totally unacceptable as we cannot have another Acting Municipal Manager. The Council must allow the current Acting Municipal Manager to finish her term as she has done nothing wrong in terms of executing her duties. The DA needs clarity on whether the MEC has granted the Lesedi Municipality permission to advertise the post, and if so, the reasons for this must be provided. It is high time that the ANC-led Lesedi administration puts the needs of the residents first by ensuring that the current Acting Municipal Manager finishes her term of office.
