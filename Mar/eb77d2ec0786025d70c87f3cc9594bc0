Resignation of Dr Morkel as CEO of the FW de Klerk Foundation The FW de Klerk Foundation wishes to announce that Dr Dayne Morkel has informed us of his decision to resign as CEO of the Foundation, with effect from 31 March. Dr Morkel will be accepting an appointment as CEO of the Foundation for Peace in Divided Societies in the United States, an organisation with which the FW de Klerk Foundation has had close ties for 20 years. Dr Morkel took this decision before the controversy that arose from the treatment of Mr De Klerk by the EFF at the State of the Nation Address and the Foundationâ€™s resulting statement of 14 February. Dr Morkel has resided between the United States and South Africa for several years, and this new role will allow him to continue to support the causes for which the FW de Klerk Foundation works, whilst focusing on a number of emerging opportunities for the Foundation in the United States. The Foundation looks forward to continuing to work with Dr Morkel in his new role. Issued by the FW de Klerk Foundation. 4 March 2020
