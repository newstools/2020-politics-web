The steps taken by the government to combat the further spread of the virus should be supported by all. However, drastic measures are envisaged if the virus spreads further. The agricultural sector is, therefore, working with the government to prioritize and guarantee the supply of fresh and essential agricultural products. The value chains that supply the products daily have the necessary precautions in place to protect workers and to keep supplies moving. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));In case of further restrictions, the harvesting, processing, distribution, delivery, and sale of agricultural products and groceries will be exempted from this.
