DA postpones Policy Conference 16 March 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) Federal Executive (FedEx) has resolved to postpone its policy conference which was scheduled to take place on 4 and 5 April due to the Covid-19 pandemic. We will use this opportunity to trial technology-based conferencing, for identified aspects of the policy discussions. The Policy Steering Committee is busy devising a plan for doing this. The FedEx has also resolved that the Party will abide strictly by the guidelines for meetings and other forms of social and professional interaction outlined by the President last night. A decision on the Federal Congress that was due to take place on 30 and 31 May will be taken at a later stage with the proviso that it must be held after the policy conference.
