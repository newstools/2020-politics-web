EFF statement on the dissolution of Tshwane Municipality  5 March 2020 The EFF welcomes the dissolution of the Tshwane Municipality announced by the Premier of Gauteng this morning. The residents of Tshwane will now have an opportunity to constitute a functional municipality after months of lack of direction and poor service delivery. The Tshwane metro currently does not have a city manager, a mayoral council or a mayor and council sittings have collapsed since last November. The DA Speaker, who refuses to allow debates in council has continuously refused to put motions on the agenda in the order in which she has received motions, even when she was petitioned by the majority of Council members. This conduct and the arrogance of those who behaved as if they won the metro is why we find ourselves in this situation. The inability to work with a collective by those charged with leading the metro is why services were not being delivered and why this council has been dissolved. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));Service delivery has been poor in Tshwane. Residents are not receiving water, refuse is not being collected and unemployment has reached levels that cannot be tolerated. We welcome the opportunity to go to elections and give our people the democratic right to elect a leadership with a fresh mandate to lead Tshwane towards functionality. As the EFF we are ready to go into a fresh round of elections and will organize our membership and ground forces towards a decisive victory.
