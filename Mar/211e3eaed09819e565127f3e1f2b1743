DA applauds DASO's groundbreaking victory 13 March 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in KwaZulu-Natal congratulates the Democratic Alliance Students' Organisation (DASO) on their outstanding victory in securing 7 out of 9 SRC seats at eThekwini Centec TVet College. This historical victory will see the DA leading its first campus in KZN. DASO will showcase the real meaning of good governance while fighting the needs of the students. We were also pleased to receive the first seat in Central SRC for the first time ever. I as the Leader together with Hannah Winkler who heads DASO in the province have full trust in the leadership that will lead the team at Centec. Since the beginning of the year, we have seen an increase in DASO membership. This is proof that young people are now putting their faith in the DA. We are encouraging more students to join DASO for accountable and clean governance in the Higher Learning Institutions. DASO encourages the culture of dialogue and negotiation rather than the use of violence. We are going to continue to grow and expand in all Institutions of learning across the province.
