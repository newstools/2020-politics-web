Vosloorus killing: DA welcomes swift action by IPID 30 March 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomes the arrest of an EMPD officer in connection with the killing of Sibusiso Amos, a 40-year old resident of Vosloorus, following swift action from the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID). This comes after Amos was allegedly shot and killed yesterday by an Ekurhuleni Metro Police Department (EMPD) officer, and a second man, enforcing the Covid-19 lockdown. South Africa is only four days into the Covid-19 lockdown and already the nation has witnessed harrowing incidents of police brutality and violence against the public. I will be submitting an incident report to IPID on all instances reported to me of excessive violence and misconduct at the hands of law enforcement officials during this time. IPID has a critically important role to play during this lockdown and must be swift, strict and unrelenting in their investigations against any criminal behaviour by law enforcement officers. While police officials have a mandate to enforce the lockdown regulations without fear or favour, the blatant display of violence; disregard of human rights and incidents of humiliation is disgraceful and goes against the very foundations of our Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The DA reiterates our call for Parliament to establish an ad hoc committee to perform Executive oversight and ensure the protection of civil liberties during the lockdown as these cases of violence and abuse cannot go unabated. The DA sends its deepest condolences to the family of Mr Amos and hopes for the speedy recovery of the children who were caught in the cross-fire.
