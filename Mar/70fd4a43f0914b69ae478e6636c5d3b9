NUPSAW encourages workers to prepare to fight for salary increases in protection of their agreement 20 March 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));The National Union of Public Service and Allied Worker (NUPSAW) representing thousands of public servants urges the public servants to prepare for a national shutdown of public facilities, if the government does not act immediately with its part of the agreement which entitles the public servants a wage increase by April 1. Following the latest talks in the Public Service Co-ordinating Bargaining Council (PSCBC), the government has presented its plan of implementing 0% salary increase for the public servants during the Special Council which took place on 17 March 2020, as a measure to optimise government spending. NUPSAW has rejected the offer by the employer along with other unions. “In an economy like South Africa and with the current pandemic Covid19 still rising, there is simply no excuse for government to give insufficient money to the workers whose efforts make the public facilities thrive. The South African government needs to take action of putting the public servants needs first” said Kagiso Makoe, NUPSAW Media Officer. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));NUPSAW reject the review of the wage bill and the government’s attempt to put its hands into the public servant’s purses. The public servant’s salaries cannot be used as a debt trap and to pay for the present massive existing governments debt while covering up for ANC governments looting corruption, stealing and interference in department systems. The failure for the government to ensure its part of the agreement is met by April 1, calls for nothing but a national shutdown considering coronavirus, this will not only hit on the local level but both the national and provincial levels will feel it too. We are also aware that government might go ahead to breach the existing agreement by implementing the 0% salary increase despite the unions approval. Failure for the employer to meet its part of the agreement on April 1, NUPSAW will reserve its right to go to court to ensure the agreement is upheld. eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2',114,'0','0']));“NUPSAW therefore urge all public workers to prepare to fight for their agreement. NUPSAW will remain resolute, we will fight for our members because that is our duty,” Kagiso. Issued by Kagiso Makoe, NUPSAW Media Officer, 20 March 2020
