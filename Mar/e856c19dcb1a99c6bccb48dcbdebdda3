SA Express Media Statement 30 March 2020 The SA Express Board of Directors announces that interim CEO Siza Mzimela will be leaving the airline to pursue other opportunities. Mzimela joined SA Express as interim CEO following her role as a member of the intervention team entrusted with the mammoth task of resuscitating the airline after it had been grounded. In just 18 months and against incredible odds, the Board and Management, made huge strides to restore the airline. All malfeasance that led to the corrosion of governance structures was eradicated. Despite her stated intention of a limited tenure at the airline, her commitment and passion for SA Express has been resolute, opting to remain with the team through highly challenging times. To ensure that the role of permanent CEO is filled, the Board put forward a recommendation of three names to the Shareholder 12 months ago and awaits a response. Ms Thuli Mpse has been appointed as Acting CEO effective 1 April 2020. The Board thanks Mzimela and wishes her well in her future endeavors.
