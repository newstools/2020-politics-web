Statement by the ANC Treasurer General, Paul Mashatile, on the release of the Report of the Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of Impropriety at the Public Investment Corporation 13 March 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));The ANC welcomed the findings of the Report of the Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of Impropriety at the Public Investment Corporation in relation to allegations of impropriety in the Karan Beef transaction. It was alleged that Mashatile had a financial interest in the deal which was approved by the PIC. It was also alleged that the deal was constructed in a manner that inflated the selling price to benefit Mashatile. The Commission, headed by the former Judge President of the Supreme Court of Appeal, Justice Lex Mpati, found that these allegations have not been substantiated and therefore have no substance. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));"Consequently, no finding of impropriety in the investment decision in the Karan Beef transaction can be made," the Report said. Mashatile said he noted that the report has vindicated him. "Throughout the proceedings of the commission, we took a principled decision not to comment on these allegation, preferring rather to give the commission ample space to do its work." Mashatile said. "Now that the Commission has completed its work and made its findings public, we believe the matter is closed," he said. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));He expressed his continued confidence in the work of institutions established to protect and entrench South Africa's democracy. Mashatile said he hoped that the PIC will continue to play a leading role in supporting South Africa's development efforts. Issued by Pule Mabe, National Spokesperson, ANC, 13 March 2020
