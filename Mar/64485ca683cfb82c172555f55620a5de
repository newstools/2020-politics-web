Delays in appointing 4th Industrial Revolution Panel negatively impacting on SMMEs 16 March 2020 Despite the fact that Premier David Makhura announced that he will be establishing a 4th Industrial Revolution Panel during his second State of the Province Address (SOPA) address last year, nothing has happened. This panel was supposed to be established within the Premier’s first 100 days of office. The delay in the establishment of this panel has had a negative impact on SMMEs which are dependent on new technology for their businesses to flourish. This panel will play an important role in ensuring how best the Gauteng Provincial Government can take advantage of the opportunities offered by the digital industrial revolution in order for the economy to grow. This will also ensure that those who are unemployed, particularly the youth are equipped with digital innovation skills. It is important as both business and government are embracing digital technology in their day-to-day work. Gauteng cannot be left behind in the digital revolution as the way in which business is done by both government and the private sector is evolving. The DA will continue to put pressure on government to ensure that the 4th Industrial Revolutionary Advisory Panel is established, so that this province will not be left behind in embracing the evolvement of technology across the globe.
