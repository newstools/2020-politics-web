Johannesburg CBD is becoming filthy, yet the ANC-led administration seems not to care 3 March 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));Since the ANC-led administration took over the reigns of the City of Joburg, the Johannesburg CBD is reverting back to the dirty City that it was before the DA-led administration took over in 2016. The current state of the Johannesburg CBD is appalling because it is filthy, and the streets are full of litter. There are also piles of garbage at all the streets corners and at the robots. This environment is dirty which is health hazard. Please see photos here, here, here and here. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));This clearly indicates that the current ANC-led administration is neglecting to keep the City clean as there is no longer regular refuse removal. The ANC are reversing the huge strides made by the DA-led administration to ensure that the CBD is kept clean. We introduced the City-wide volunteer cleaning campaign called A Re Sebetseng which calls on the communities to take ownership of their spaces through the participation in joint clean-up initiatives. It is high time that the ANC-led administration considers taking the urgent steps required in order to have a clean Joburg CBD. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));The DA firmly believes that a clean City attracts investors which will help with job creation. We call on people to refrain from littering and to make use of street dustbins for the disposal of litter. Issued by Sergio Isa dos Santos, DA Gauteng Inner City Joburg Constituency Head, 3 March 2020
