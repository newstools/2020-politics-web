Infrastructure-led economic growth promised by Gauteng Government is a cruel lie 9 March 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));The biggest shock in the Gauteng budget presented last Thursday is the decision to drastically cut the expected allocation to infrastructure development. This flies in the face of Premier Makhura's numerous promises of infrastructure-led economic growth promised in his recent State of the Province address. The Department of Health, which requires R6 billion just to become occupational health and safety compliant, has been allocated an additional R18 million more than last year. No, you are not reading this number incorrectly. R18 million. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));Learners in Gauteng will be under increased risk of crumbling infrastructure as the overall budget for maintenance and repairs has been reduced by R159 million and the budget for educational infrastructure has been reduced by R163 million. Human Settlements has been allocated R420 million less than last year and Infrastructure Development R159 million less. The chickens have come home to roost. Years of poor policy choices, mismanagement and corruption have brought us to this point. There is simply not enough money to go around. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));So, Premier Makhura's numerous promises of huge infrastructure investments over the next 10 years is likely to be pie in the sky. His party has bankrupted us. Issued by Alan Fuchs, DA Gauteng Shadow MEC for Infrastructure Development and Property Management, 9 March 2020
