DA encouraged after court hearing on fate of Tshwane Council 25 March 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) is encouraged to note that the judges in the North Gauteng High Court regarded the DAâ€™s application, to overturn the ANC decision to place the Tshwane Council under administration, as very urgent. We are confident that all the issues were fully canvassed and that the judgement will be handed down soon. The verdict will be important not only for the people of Tshwane, but to the residents of every single council after the elections next year in which there is a minority government. If the ANC is in power in eight of the nine provinces and there are councils that are vulnerable, this judgement will determine whether the principle of separation of powers at the different spheres of government and their equal rights to exist is upheld and protected, or whether they will be vulnerable to attack by a super dominant ANC. The DA brought this review to court, primarily for the sake of the residents of Tshwane, to stop a disgraceful power grab. IssuedbyRandall Williams,DA Tshwane Mayoral Candidate, 25 March 2020
