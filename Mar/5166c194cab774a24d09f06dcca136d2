Reports of German repatriation flights are circulating in the South African media. The Embassy would like to clarify: We are working hard on solutions to get German tourists in South Africa back home. Work on these plans has not been concluded. There are still many open questions, among them issues related to the strict South African lockdown rules, eg on air traffic. We cannot confirm at this stage, if, how and when repatriation flights might take place. We are in good and trustful talks with the South African government on this matter, as well as with other partners. We will inform the concerned German tourists as soon as all open questions have been clarified. Until then, we have to ask all to remain patient.
