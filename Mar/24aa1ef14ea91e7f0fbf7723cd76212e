The announcement included a prohibition of non-essential gatherings of 100 people or more. “Up to now, we have seen hundreds of people attending each session at the public hearings. It is clear the need for land is urgent and huge crowds attend. In light of this, we are mindful not to expose more South Africans to COVID-19, also known as the coronavirus,” Dr Motshekga said. The committee was due to hold public hearings at Parliament from tomorrow. It has already held hearings in the Free State, Mpumalanga, North West, KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape and Gauteng.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0'])); Dr Motshekga said the committee will keep the public informed as to when the public hearings will resume.
