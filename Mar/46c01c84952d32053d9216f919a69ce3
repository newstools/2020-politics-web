Earlier in the year, Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi bemoaned the fact that he had spent more time comforting grieving families than doing what his department was tasked with. "I can't be issuing death certificates. I need to be issuing report cards and information that builds the education system," he said. "We are turning our schools into mortuaries and it can't be like that. We must stop that." This is a developing story. News24
