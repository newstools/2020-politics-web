SCOPA wants monthly reports from SAPS on illegal R475m agreement without contract 17 March 2020 The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) has requested the South African Police Service (Saps) to provide monthly reports on the investigation into the R475 million that was paid to Telkom without a contract in place. The committee has requested that these monthly reports should be submitted to the committee by 18 April 2020. Another illegal agreement without a contract that Scopa will be scrutinizing closely is with a company called Digicore, which has an agreement with the State Information Technology Agency (Sita) to provide automated vehicle location services to Saps. This illegal agreement has been in place since 2010, when the original contract expired. Saps is paying an estimated R3.6 million per month to Sita for this service. Scopa will request a schedule of all Sita contracts with Saps, as well as the status of those contracts. This is to enable Scopa to engage with both parties regarding the control, environment and contract management of all services rendered to Saps by Sita. Scopa has also requested a report on the circumstances that have allowed Major-GeneralÂ Dladla to remain at work with no suspension, even though she is implicated in eight cases currently under investigation, while other implicated persons are on suspension. Scopa will be in constant communication with Saps after it receives the full report on investigations and other matters that relate to irregular expenditure.
