Justice Minister must be consistent with granting parole 6 March 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));The manner in which the Department of Justice and Correctional Services is handling the parole process of the so-called 'Coffin Case', Theo Jackson and Willem Oosthuizen, is inconsistent. The Correctional Supervision and Parole Board decided to grant Jackson and Oosthuizen parole. However, Oosthuizen was literally stopped in his tracks as he was leaving the prison and on Thursday night, Jackson was arrested at his home exactly one week after he was released on parole. The fact that the National Commissioner of Correctional Services decided, in terms of the Correctional Services Act, to table a motion to review the Parole Board's decision because the victim, Victor Mlotshwa, was not consulted during the parole consideration of the two accused points to poor internal processes as well as unfair and discriminatory action against Jackson and Oosthuizen. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));Just recently, after the murder of Tazne van Wyk, the Minister of Justice and Correctional Services, Ronald Lamola, admitted that the parole system is flawed and that it is "unpredictable". Based solely on the merit of the case, the FF Plus will put pressure on the Minister and his Department to correct the 'Coffin Case' mistake and to apologise to the two families because persons who have been granted parole also have the right to be treated fairly.
