ANC and EFF in Tshwane continue to defy the oath they took for office 10 March 2020 Today, yet again, the ANC and EFF have defied the oath they took for office in 2016 and the code of conduct for councillors when they decided to not show up for the Tshwane Council meeting. They continue to have a deliberate disregard for the code of conduct which clearly states that they should attend council meetings. The Democratic Alliance (DA) has noted the mockery from the ANC Caucus Leadership in Tshwane, who decided to rather attend the council meeting by sitting in the gallery instead of the chamber itself. The comments and unruly laughter from the gallery by Kgosi Maepa and other ANC caucus members displayed a total disregard for Council proceedings. They treated it as a joke. This is not the type of conduct that one would expect from those who claim to put the people first. The DA and its coalition partners took the time to attend the meeting, with the belief that parties could put their differences aside and focus on the residents of Tshwane. The DA will report the conduct of the councillors and their blatant refusal to attend the meeting yet again to the MEC and will demand that he puts his party politics aside and does what he is appointed to do. We call on MEC Maile to uphold the rule of law and take immediate action in terms of Section 3, 4 and 14 of the Code of Conduct against the ANC and EFF Councillors, that requires councillors to attend Council meetings diligently and not to bring the Council into disrepute. While MEC Maile and the ANC Councillors continue to play political games and make jokes of the residents of Tshwane and the very office they were elected to, the DA will continue to serve the residents of Tshwane.
