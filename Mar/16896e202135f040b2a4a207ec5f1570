DA calls for suspension of arrested eThekwini City Manager 10 March 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));The Democratic Alliance (DA) in eThekwini notes the arrest today of City Manager, Sipho Nzuza, by the Hawks. Nzuza appeared in the Durban Commercial Crimes Court this morning and was charged in connection with the Durban Solid Waste (DSW) tender matter. The DA calls for Council to be urgently convened to suspend him and we will write to the Speaker to request her to do so. Twenty-two other people have been arrested in connection with these charges since last year, including six councillors. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));The state alleges that Nzuza "aligned himself with tender outcomes" and "colluded" with other accused persons. This arrest proves what the DA has insisted for some time- that eThekwini Municipality is corrupt from the top to the bottom, and that the ANC effectively elected a criminal syndicate into government in Durban in 2016. Since 2016, eThekwini residents have been plagued by failing services and a completely incapable city that has not been able to fulfil its Constitutional basic mandate. The core of this problem is that line departments and city functions have been captured by ANC councillors and comrades in their quest to loot the city's coffers. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2',114,'0','0']));The corrupt politics of the ANC is why DSW cannot keep our communities clean, why GoDurban cannot get off the ground, why Ethekwini Water and Sanitation can't keep the taps running and why the Parks department spend millions on events and concerts but can't cut the grass. These things are not coincidences. They're the net result of a corrupt, criminal syndicate running a city. There are 58 Councillors who have been mentioned in court proceedings that have not yet been arrested. Our sources indicate that more arrests are imminent, and we encourage the Hawks to act swiftly in bringing these Councillors to justice. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','0']));The DA will closely monitor the process of this case, and urge the courts and NPA to act swiftly. The people of eThekwini deserve some justice at last. Issued byÂ Nicole Graham,DA eThekwini Caucus Leader, 10 March 2020
