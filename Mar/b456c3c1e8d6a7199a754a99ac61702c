They are depending on the partner," De Lille said on Wednesday. "We want to say to women, you don't have to stay in that abusive relationship but walk away… that is why as government, we want to make these safe houses, shelters available across the country…" Last year, the two national ministers announced that the first four buildings had been identified in Pretoria. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));The social development department is equipping the buildings as shelters for women and children and making sure the necessary psycho-social support is provided to survivors once they are open. De Lille also challenged municipalities to release land and property for similar shelters. News24
