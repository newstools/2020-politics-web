DA questions SASSA CEO’s exorbitant R2.65 million salary 19 March 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) can reveal that the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) CEO, BusisiweMemela-Khambula, earns almost R1 million more per annum than her predecessors. This information came to light in a written response by the Minister of Social Development, Lindiwe Zulu, to a DA parliamentary question. The reply revealed that Memela-Khambula, who was appointed in May 2019, receives an annual salary of R2.65 million. This is almost R1 million more than the former acting SASSA CEO, Abraham Mahlangu, who earned more than R1.6 million per annum. The DA plans to submit further parliamentary questions to ascertain why Memela-Khambula is receiving this inflated salary when the average salary of her three predecessors at SASSA was around R1.2 million per annum. Minister of Finance, Tito Mboweni, stated in his budget speech that spending money on excessive public servant salaries should be stopped. It is, therefore, a matter of public interest that we know the reasoning behind Memela-Khambula’s exorbitant salary. Issued by Bridget Masango,DA Shadow Minister of Social Development, 19 March 2020
