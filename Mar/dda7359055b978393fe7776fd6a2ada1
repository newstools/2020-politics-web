Tshwane Administrator must stay clear of political duels 27 March 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) calls on the politically appointed Tshwane Administrator Mpho Nawa to stay clear of political duels. During his first media briefing yesterday, Nawa behaved like a typical political deployee by attempting to score points for his party the African National Congress (ANC). One such reckless comment was that "irregular expenditure in the city has skyrocketed to a billion," which shows how misinformed he is. He failed to acknowledge that the City of Tshwane under the DA-led administration recently received an unqualified audit report from the Auditor-General. Since taking over the administration of the City of Tshwane in 2016, the DA has been hard at work to rid the city of illegal contracts entered into by the ANC such as the PEU smart metering, Tshwane Broadband and Moipone Fleet contracts which have contributed to the city's irregular expenditure. It is quite ironic how someone who ran two failed ANC municipalities into the ground can boldly cast doubt on the state of the City of Tshwane's finances. By spreading these lies, Nawa is insulting the very municipal officials he is supposed to be leading. Nawa is a risk to the residents of Tshwane's hard-earned money. Furthermore he mentioned the "unlocking of critical projects such as the upgrading of the Rooiwal Waste Water Treatment Plant." Seemingly his political masters did not give him terms of reference that serve as a guideline on what he must concentrate on for the duration of the ANC's unlawful three/month intervention in the city. Dear Mr. Mpho Nawa, the DA-led administration had already awarded a R250 million tender for the refurbishment of the Rooiwal Waste Water Treatment Plant. One would hope that Nawa is aware that the problems at the City of Tshwane are due to the ANC’s political game playing and not administrative issues.
