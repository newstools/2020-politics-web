The Presidency welcomes Rev Meshoe’s adherence to the testing protocol and wishes him well as he awaits his results. eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2',114,'0','0']));The President himself is in good health and is observing the announced protocols as stringently as he can while performing his duties. At this point in time there is no cause for concern about the President’s health or reason for the President to be tested.
