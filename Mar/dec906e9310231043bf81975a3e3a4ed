Falling windows, leaks and potholes at newly built Thelle Mogoerane hospital 2 March 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));The ThelleMogoerane Hospital was opened as a state-of-the-art facility six years ago but suffers from major building defects that will cost more than R11.5 million to fix. This is revealed by Gauteng Health MEC Bandile Masuku in a written reply to my questions in the Gauteng Legislature. The following defects have been detected: eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));some windows falling off when opened poor flooring strength at Accident and Emergency, resulting in potholes sewer line blockage at Nurses Residence eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2',114,'0','0']));cracks in the wall major roof leaks inadequate storm water drainage system The roof leaks are so bad that there has been flooding of upper level wards, and there are random leaks on other floors. It is estimated that it will cost R7 million to fix these leaks which are caused by water pipe services not connected and sealed properly during the construction phase. Other estimated repair costs include R3.8 million to fix the floors at Accident and Emergency, R400 000 for the windows and R250 000 for the sewer line blockage. This totals R11.45 million, and more is needed as reports are awaited about the cost to fix the wall cracks and the storm water drainage. According to Masuku “the estimated cost to fix the structural and design faults will only be available after the assessments, findings and recommendations have been completed by the consultants.” This hospital took eight years to be built and cost R1.6 billion, which was double the original budget. It is very disappointing that staff and patients are yet again suffering because of shoddy work by a building contractor that will cost a lot of money to fix. There should be penalty clauses to claim money from such a contractor. eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-banner-1','ezslot_3',116,'0','0']));The provincial government should take special care in selecting decent companies to build the six new hospitals that are planned in Gauteng.
