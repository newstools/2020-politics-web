Solidarity demands answers from department about race criteria applicable to Covid-19 emergency aid funds 24 March 2020 Solidarity today sent a letter to the Department of Small Business Development requesting that government confirm before close of business today that race will play no role in granting assistance to small businesses. Solidarity has learnt from the media that correspondence that is doing the rounds in this regard is fake news. “For this reason, Solidarity demands confirmation from the department that race is not a criterion. If race does in any way form part of the criteria we will proceed with urgent litigation. The effect of the virus knows no colour and for this reason support of its drastic effects should not have colour either,” Dirk Hermann, Solidarity Chief Executive concluded.
