Cuba doctors training money should be redirected to Gauteng medical schools  28 February 2020eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0'])); The Democratic Alliance welcomes Gauteng Premier David Makhura’s announcement in his State of the Province (SOPA) address that the Provincial Government is working with the University of Johannesburg to fast-track the building of a new Medical School. We desperately need to train more doctors in order to meet the health needs of a growing population. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));Makhura has not indicated any provincial funding to assist the new medical school and has also ignored the need to assist the Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University where he delivered his SOPA address. Last year the Provincial Government spent more than R130 million on the Cuban doctor's programme at double the cost to train a doctor locally. The programme also requires an extra year to learn Spanish, and another year in a South African medical school when returning home. Medical training in Cuba should be wound down as soon as possible in favour of extra spending on local doctor training.
