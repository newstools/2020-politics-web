Cele must ensure EFF rogue command are stopped  27 March 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) has noted with concern the EFF’s threats to shut down companies and “pay them a special visit” during the lockdown. The EFF has taken to social media to threaten and intimidate businesses who they believe are not essential services or who they believe have inflated prices. The EFF’s violent behaviour is well known, and the South African Police Service (SAPS) must move swiftly to prevent any violence against businesses and their employees at the hands of the EFF’s rogue command. The SAPS, with the support of the South African National Defence Force, are the only institutions mandated to enforce the regulations relating to the lockdown. The EFF has no authority to enforce any regulations or laws and their reckless behaviour during a time of national uncertainty is grossly irresponsible. I will be writing to Minister Bheki Cele to inform him of these threats and request that SAPS take control of the situation to prevent any illegal behaviour at the hands of the EFF.
