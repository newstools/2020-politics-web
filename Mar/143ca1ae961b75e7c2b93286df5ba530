NW Department of Social Development 'running out of funds', leaves over 100 disabled persons destitute 9 March 2020 Note to Editors: Kindly find attached soundbites in English and Afrikaans by DA North West Spokesperson on Health and Social Development, Gavin Edwards MPL.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0'])); The Democratic Alliance (DA) in North West last week conducted an oversight inspection to two Non-Government Organisations (NGOs), Theist and Daphne Lee Disability Centres in Klerksdorp that assist more than 100 persons living with disabilities. From our engagement with the management, it transpired that subsidies for the past four months have not been paid. The reasons cited for the non-payment was that the Department of Social Development’s budget is depleted, which is not only a breach of the signed service level agreement, but has also resulted in the centres having to utilise their reserve funds to continue providing the much-needed service to the most vulnerable in society. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));Last Thursday, during a plenary sitting in the North West Provincial Legislature (NWPL), we delivered a Member statement on the plight of the centres and noted MEC Boitumelo Moiloa’s response that she has “dispersed officials to go into those district offices”. We have previously directed questions to Premier Mokgoro during a plenary sitting who stated that officials responsible for this non-payment will be receiving final written warnings as part of consequence management measures. To this end, we will again submit written questions to the MEC to ascertain the number of registered NGO’s that qualify for subsidies, a list of outstanding payments, reasons for non-payment, when payment will be made, a progress report on the findings of the officials that was to investigate the matter and also what action will be taken. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));The DA will continue to engage the Department for timeous payment to registered NGO’s to ensure the dignity of persons failed by a collapsing government.
