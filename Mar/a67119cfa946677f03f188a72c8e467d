Gauteng homeless at high risk of contracting coronavirus 12 March 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng is deeply concerned that the homeless people are at a high risk of contracting the coronavirus. This follows the recent outbreak of the coronavirus where at least seven people in the country have been tested positive thus far. Gauteng is amongst the two provinces in the country that have recorded cases of the coronavirus. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));Both the provincial and national government have identified hospitals to deal with this virus, however nothing has been mentioned about the homeless. The homeless are the most vulnerable to the coronavirus which spreads primarily through respiratory droplets coughed or sneezed from an infected person. The homeless people who mostly survive on selling recycling materials, collecting scrap and eating from the dustbins are at a risk of contracting coronavirus by touching dirty tissues from the dustbins. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2',114,'0','0']));Furthermore, in order to prevent this virus from spreading people should wash their hands with soap or sanitiser regularly and for homeless people this will be impossible as they cannot afford these materials. If a person has contracted the virus, they should be isolated from other people; they should rest and recuperate at home. This will be a challenge for homeless people because they do not have shelter. For far too long the DA has been pleading with the ANC-led Gauteng administration to offer vacant old buildings to homeless community as shelters. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','0']));There are not enough shelters for the homeless because the government has consistently failed to provide adequate resources to NGOs which render this most needed service. The DA will table questions in the Gauteng Provincial Legislature (GPL) to ascertain what plans are in place to ensure that the homeless in the province are also protected from contracting the coronavirus.
