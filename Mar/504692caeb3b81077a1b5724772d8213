DA calls for urgent Council meeting to discuss the R53 million spent on overtime at JB Marks Local Municipality 10 March 2020 Note to Editors: Please find the attached soundbite in English and Afrikaans by Hans Jurie-Moolman, DA Councillor in JB Marks Local Municipality.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0'])); The Democratic Alliance (DA) will write to the JB Marks Local Municipality Speaker, Kgosiemang Elias Mogoemang, requesting an urgent Council meeting to table the investigation report into the overtime of municipal workers which has amounted to almost R53 million in only seven months since July 2019 and up until January 2020. The municipality has spent a total of R52 990 960 since July 2019 the amount which paid for a total amount of 383574 hours of overtime. The JB Marks Local Municipality is spending  1.5 to two times more than the normal hourly rate on overtime payments. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));These figures are more astounding when a detailed breakdown of the actual overtime hours per employee is considered. By law, workers can only consent to work a maximum of forty-five hours per week and these figures show that workers are way over that limit. In some instances, the total overtime paid to certain employees amounted to 288 hours worked per month. It is completely unacceptable and physically and mentally impossible for employees to work so many overtime hours in addition to their normal 180 hours they need to put in for the month. Last year April, the DA wrote a letter to the Executive Mayor, Kgotso Khumalo and the Municipal Manager, raising concerns regarding this, however, to date no response was given. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2',114,'0','0']));We then raised the matter in Council to which the Accounting Officer admitted that there was a huge problem with the overtime and that the municipality’s internal audit had red-flagged this. He also advised that an investigation be launched into the matter. A year has passed and no report or feedback has been given and from the figures that were given, it would appear that the monthly overtime amount paid has increased from R2.5 million in 2018 to a staggering R8.9 million in January 2020. It is unacceptable that this issue continues to be ignored by the Mayor, Municipal Manager and the management at the municipality. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','0']));The DA calls for an urgent Council meeting so that the administration and the Executive Mayor can table the outcomes of the investigation that was supposed to have commenced in May/June 2019. The DA will also report this exploitive behaviour of the workers to the Department of Labour so that a full audit can be conducted and for remedial actions to be taken. Allowing this situation to continue is not good for the well-being of workers and it opens the municipality to lawsuits for exploiting workers. It is unacceptable that these amounts of overtime get paid in the face of a very high vacancy rate at the municipality and the current high unemployment rate. It is impossible to contemplate why management would pay a person 1.5x or double the hourly rate when the filling of vacancies and remuneration at a normal hourly rate offers a much more viable alternative.
