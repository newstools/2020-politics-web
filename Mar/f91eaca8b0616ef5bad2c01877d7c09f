NqabaBhanga steps down as MPL to stand as NMB Mayoral Candidate 4 March 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));Today, Wednesday 4 March 2020, I have submitted my resignation to the Speaker of the Eastern Cape Legislature, Helen Sauls-August, and will be stepping down as a Member of the Legislature with immediate effect, in order to stand as the Democratic Alliance’s mayoral candidate for Nelson Mandela Bay. Following my resignation from the Legislature, I will be sworn in as a councillor and will be rejoining the Democratic Alliance’s Nelson Mandela Bay caucus to stand as mayoral candidate. This has not been an easy decision for me, but I believe that Nelson Mandela Bay, the city of my birth, is in crisis and requires urgent intervention. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));It needs men and women who can change this situation for the better. The city can’t continue in this tragedy of collapsing services and governance. Former Member of the Provincial Legislature, Kobus Botha, who is currently serving as a proportional representative councillor in the Nelson Mandela Bay council, and who is next on the list, will be returning to the Legislature. I will continue to work closely with the Eastern Cape Legislature team in my capacity as DA provincial Leader. I have full confidence in the Legislature team to continue leading the charge to fix our broken province and fight for an environment of rising opportunity for all.
