EFF calls for all coronavirus infected persons to be state quarantined 14 March 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));The EFF calls for the immediate quarantine of all coronavirus infected persons. According to the Department of Health, South Africa has 24 confirmed cases of Coronavirus; all these 24 Individuals have been allowed to self-quarantine. This means there is no supervision whatsoever of their activities or any guarantee that they have indeed quarantined. It is ironic that over 130 South Africans from Wuhan who have been confirmed not to be infected will be under forced, state quarantine. Yet, people who are infected are allowed to "self-quarantine". This shows the inconsistency and absolute incompetence South African government policy on the spread of the virus. If 130 individuals who are confirmed not to be infected can be quarantined because they come from a country infested with the virus, how much more about people who are in fact infected? The risk does not come from the 130 South Africans from China, it comes from infected persons allowed by the authorities to self-quarantine. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));We call for the immediate quarantine of all who are infected; preferably in Robben Island. It is clear that South Africa does not have a special Coronavirus facility to commit the infected persons to. This, Robben Island or a special facility must be immediately identified and prepared for medical care of all persons infected with Coronavirus. It is irresponsible and utterly dangerous for the government to allow unmonitored self-quarantine. This did not work in other countries and will obviously not work here. Coronavirus will sweep all over our country with a supersonic speed, all because the government lacked the courage to quarantine the infected. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));Finally we call for a ban on all travels from Coronavirus infected countries, in particular Europe.
