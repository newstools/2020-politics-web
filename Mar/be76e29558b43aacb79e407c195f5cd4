South Africans called to rise to the occasion of an unprecedented medical emergency 15 March 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));We support President Ramaphosa’s call on South Africans to rally behind the common purpose of containing and mitigating the impacts of the Coronavirus in South Africa. We are in unchartered waters of a medical emergency that will test our already fragile institutional, social and economic realities. The President announced a robust and comprehensive set of interventions intended to contain the spread of the virus. The intrusion and inconvenience of these measures, under a state of disaster, are warranted. Our country is called upon to act in solidarity with each other and in pursuit of the common purpose. We believe in the inherent capacity of the people of our beloved country to rise to the occasion that this unprecedented medical emergency imposes on us. We call on every person who calls South Africa home to do their part in containing this virus and getting South Africa through this crisis. We welcome the interventions to minimise risk of exposure through travel bans, rescheduling the school terms and cancellation of gatherings and events. South Africans are resilient, resourceful and compassionate people.  Together we will navigate this crisis. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_5',115,'0','0']));We remain extremely concerned about the impact of this medical emergency, and the necessary interventions, on our fragile economy. Government must urgently announce how it will support our economy and businesses, especially small businesses, to navigate the impact of these measures.
