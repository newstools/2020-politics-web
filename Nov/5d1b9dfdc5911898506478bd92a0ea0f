The job of the police is clear and is prescribed in the Constitution, which is to protect, prevent, combat and investigate crime. Police are also there to uphold and enforce the law, so no one has the right to threaten the police when they conduct their work.” Minister Cele has called on members of the police service to protect themselves. The Minister is confident that if needs be, police are more than capable of defending themselves, should they be under any attack. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));“The threat to the lives of police members and their families will not be tolerated, officers of the law should never be used as bait for political mileage.” concluded Cele.
