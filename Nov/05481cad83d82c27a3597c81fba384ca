DA calls on Premier to investigate economic sabotage 20 November 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));The DA in Gauteng is appalled by the coordinated attacks on approximately 20 trucks last night on the N3, R550 and R23 near Nigel and Heidelberg. These attacks were clearly coordinated and not part of another community protest and amounts to economic sabotage. The damage will amount to tens of millions of rands as expensive vehicles were destroyed and their loads were either damaged or destroyed. The movement of goods on our roads is vital to the Gauteng and South African economy and we should do everything in our power to protect truckers and their loads. We therefore call on the Premier of Gauteng to immediately launch an investigation into this economic sabotage and to bring the guilty to book. This was clearly an organised criminal act and the perpetrators need to be brought to book to send a clear message that this type of criminality will not be tolerated. We cannot afford to have our economy held to ransom and sabotaged in this way. Especially after the devastating effects of the Corona virus on our economy. We need to do everything in our power to protect and grow our economy so that jobs can be created again. We call on the Premier to act swiftly and announce, as a matter of urgency, what action he will be taking in this regard.
