Zondo is sending the right message with decision to prosecute Myeni 27 November 2020 The FF Plus supports the decision of Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo to have Dudu Myeni, former SAA chairperson, criminally prosecuted. This follows shortly after his decision to also have former President Jacob Zuma prosecuted. It is important that Judge Zondo takes strict action against those who violate the Commissions Act. While testifying, Myeni was reportedly in contempt of an instruction given by Zondo as she revealed the identity of a so-called Mr X. Zondo's response sends a loud and clear message to all individuals who are subpoenaed to testify that the Commission is serious about exposing corruption. It is in South Africa's best interest that the guilty parties are ultimately charged and criminally prosecuted for their misdeeds towards the taxpayers of South Africa.
