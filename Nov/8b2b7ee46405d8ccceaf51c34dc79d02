179 606 Gauteng learners did not receive dignity packs 25 November 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng is disappointed to learn that 179 606 learners across Gauteng did not receive their dignity packs during the second quarter of the 2020/21 financial year. This information was revealed by the Gauteng Department of Social Development in their second quarter report for the 2020/21 financial year. According to the second quarter report for the 2020/21 financial year, the department distributed 266 026 dignity packs compared to the target of 445 632 dignity packs. This means that 179 606 learners across Gauteng did not receive their dignity packs. Failure by this department to meet its target of distributing dignity packs is unacceptable. Furthermore, the department reprioritized R83 million from the dignity packs to food parcels during its special adjustment budget for the 2020/21 financial year. The department claims that due to the fact that the schools were closed due to lockdown as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic they could not locate learners who are beneficiaries of the dignity packs. While Covid-19 meant the shutting down of schools, vulnerable and deserving girl children still went on their menstruation periods. The department needs to look into innovative ways to ensure that dignity packs are distributed even when schools are closed. The DA calls on the Gauteng MEC for Social Development, NomathembaMokgethi to establish a database of contact details of all the beneficiaries of the dignity packs to ensure that all our learners across Gauteng access this service consistently without any interruptions.
