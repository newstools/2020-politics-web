ANC Western Cape statement on the outcomes of the by-elections 12 November 2020 The ANC Western Cape welcomes the outcomes of the by-elections that took place on Wednesday, 11 November 2020. While the ANC retained its traditional wards in the Dullah Omar region, we continued to field candidates in what is considered hostile areas and we are proud to see that we are making progress in those areas. On Wednesday we triumphed in two wards in the Dullah Omar region. We want to congratulate incoming councillors NomthaNokuzolaDilima and Siphiwo Patrick Nqamnduka. We are encouraged and believe that we will radically improve on our results of the 2016 Local Government Elections when the country votes in next yearâ€™s LGE. We want to thank those voters who trusted us with their votes and undertake to fight in their best interests and ensure accountability in municipalities across the province. There will be no easy ride to 2021 for the right-wing DA. The DA is not unbeatable in the Western Cape. We saw yesterday that voters are deserting the DA The ANC also wants to thank all our volunteers for their selfless service. They know as well as we do that the road to 2021 lies ahead. The DA must be removed from power, the ANC will continue to work to regain the trust and confidence of the people of the Western Cape Issued by Lerumo Kalako, Convener, ANC WCape, 12 November 2020
