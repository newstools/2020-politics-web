DA appoints SiviweGwarube as its new National Spokesperson 24 November 2020 The DA is proud to announce the appointment of SiviweGwarube as its new National Spokesperson, following a decision taken yesterday at a meeting of our Federal Executive. I have worked closely with Siviwe in recent years, both as member of our Parliamentary caucus and on our Covid and Lockdown response team, and I have full confidence in her abilities to fulfil this important role for our party. She brings a wealth of political experience as well as a level-headed maturity to this key position. Siviwe is no stranger to important responsibilities, having previously served as the Head of Ministry for the Western Cape Minister of Health, after which she was appointed the DA’s Executive Director of Communications. More recently she was our spokesperson on the Covid-19 response. She has performed with distinction in all these roles. In addition to her duties as National Spokesperson, she will continue to serve on the DA’s shadow cabinet as our Shadow Minister of Health – a role in which she has excelled to date. She will also serve as a co-opted member on the party’s Federal Executive. I would like to thank our two outgoing spokespersons, Refiloe Nt'sekhe and Solly Malatsi, for their professional and committed service in these roles since 2015 and 2018 respectively. They have both done an excellent job for the DA, and I have no doubt that Siviwe is up to the task of filling their considerable shoes.
