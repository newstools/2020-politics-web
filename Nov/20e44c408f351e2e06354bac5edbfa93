DA demands action after gross negligence at Mafikeng Provincial Hospital causes woman’s body to decompose 5 November 2020 Note to Editors: Kindly find attached soundbites in English and Afrikaans by DA North West Spokesperson on Health and Social Development, Gavin Edwards.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0'])); The Democratic Alliance (DA) in North West will write to the MEC for Department of Health, Madoda Sambatha, demanding the immediate suspension of the mortuary staff at the Mafikeng Provincial Hospital responsible for the badly decomposed body of Rose Mosikare. According to the family, Rose was taken to the hospital after sustaining a head injury where she passed away on 25 October. When they arrived the next day to move the body to a funeral parlour, they were requested to return after the autopsy that was scheduled for 27 October. When they arrived the day after, it was found that the mortuary staff failed to ensure that the mortal remains are stored correctly. This is in contravention with the Regulations relating to the Management of Human Remains Act and is a violation of the deceased’s human dignity. The family, outraged and traumatised by the state that the body was in, laid a formal complaint demanding answers. The Department responded with a feeble apology and the CEO attempted to coerce them into burying the body as soon as possible. We extend our heartfelt condolences to the family of the deceased and demand that this horrific incident be investigated without delay. Criminal charges should be laid against those found guilty of negligence and misconduct. The spotlight is again placed on the poor quality of care provided in provincial medical facilities that is costing the Department billions of Rand each year in medical negligence claims. The DA will closely monitor the situation to ensure that justice is served. Issued byGavin Edwards,DA North West Spokesperson on Health, 5 November 2020
