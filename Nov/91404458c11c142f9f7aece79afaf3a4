Minister of Home Affairs evades question about lockdown regulations and ANCâ€™s visit to Zimbabwe 3 November 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0']));The Minister of Home Affairs, Dr Aaron Motsoaledi, provided an unacceptable and evasive answer to a parliamentary question posed by the FF Plus about the ANC's controversial visit to Zimbabwe and in particular whether the members of the delegation complied with the lockdown regulations. The delegation travelled to Zimbabwe on a Falcon 900 military aircraft on the 8th of September this year. Dr Pieter Groenewald, leader of the FF Plus, asked whether the passengers had all obtained the necessary authorisation to travel across national borders, what the passengers' names are, how approval for such a journey was obtained in terms of Level Two lockdown regulations and whether such approval was indeed obtained beforehand. eval(ez_write_tag([[468,60],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0']));Dr Motsoaledi responded by saying that President Cyril Ramaphosa is investigating the matter and that the President will deal with it accordingly. (Complete question and response attached herewith.) The response is unacceptable and Dr Motsoaledi is shirking his responsibilities as Minister of Home Affairs. His answer creates the impression that the regulations were not complied with and that is the reason why he is circumventing the question. At no point did the President indicate that he will investigate whether the government's lockdown regulations were complied with as regards the flight. He was only involved in determining the cost of the flight and ensuring that the money is recouped from the ANC. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_4',114,'0','0']));The response indicates that the Minister is neglecting his duty towards Parliament and a follow-up question was posed to Dr Motsoaledi, demanding proper answers. The matter will also be referred to Parliament's Speaker, Thandi Modise, seeing as ministers may not be allowed to shirk their responsibility towards Parliament in this way. Parliament and the people of South Africa are entitled to know whether or not the applicable regulations were complied with. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_3',115,'0','0']));The ruling party simply cannot knowingly violate the government's own regulations while insisting that the public must strictly adhere to the regulations. If the regulations were indeed violated, there must be consequences and the FF Plus will not allow the Minister to sweep it under the rug. Issued by Pieter Groenewald, FF Plus leader, 3 November 2020
