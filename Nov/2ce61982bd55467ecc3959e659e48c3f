Another year of clean audits confirms commitment to good governance 2 November 2020 The Auditor General of South Africa (AGSA) has completed the audit for the 2019/20 financial year in the Western Cape. We are pleased to announce that of the 22 provincial departments and entities that received an audit outcome, 21 (96%) of the auditees received an "unqualified" audit outcome on their annual financial statements, while 17 (77%) received a coveted "clean" audit (unqualified with no findings). One department , the Department of Health, has not been finalised due to a delay by the AGSA as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. They have estimated that the audit results for the Department of Health will be finalised in January 2021. In the 2019/20 financial year, of the 12 Western Cape Government departments that received audit outcomes, 10 received “an unqualified opinion with no findings”, or “clean audit”, 1 received an “unqualified opinion with findings”, and 1 received a “qualified opinion with findings”. The Department of Agriculture remains qualified as a result of a long-standing matter of a technical nature. After a Western Cape High court exonerated the department, we now await the matter to be finally determined by the supreme court of appeal.
