SASCOC needs to provide readiness plans for upcoming virtual elections 5 November 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) calls on the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (SASCOC) to present its full readiness plans for their upcoming virtual conference to elect a new president and board. In light of the Covid-19 restrictions on gatherings, we regard SASCOC’s move to hold elections virtually as a progressive move that will ensure the continuation of its internal democratic processes. Our main concern, however, is whether SASCOC has done the necessary planning and preparation to ensure that the elections are free and fair. This is because not all the queries around the process and logistic have been properly communicated. While we support the move for virtual elections, it appears as though SASCOC has not given itself enough time to properly prepare. This might jeopardise the integrity of the elections which is set to take place over the weekend. SASCOC cannot survive a leadership race marred by controversy. The DA, last weekend, successfully hosted South Africa’s biggest virtual elective congress and we therefore appreciate the amount of planning and preparation that goes into such an endeavor. We call on the Minister of Sports, Arts and Culture, Nathi Mthethwa, to engage SASCOC to release its readiness plans for their upcoming leadership virtual elections. For far too long, SASCOC has been marred by internal squabbles, maladministration, and corruption allegation and political meddling which have affected its ability to deliver the country’s best athletes to international sports arenas. These elections will therefore be an important stepping stone to get its house is not in order, however, there needs to be certainty that the elections will be free, fair and independent.
