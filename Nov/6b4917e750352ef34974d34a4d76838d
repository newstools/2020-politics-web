Top Gauteng Health officials not security vetted 4 November 2020 Acting Gauteng Health Jacob Mamabolo has disclosed in an oral reply to my questions at yesterday’s sitting of the Gauteng Legislature that his department is conducting a review of all security vetting processes of senior officials. He was responding to my questions on how many senior officials had been appointed since January last year without passing a security audit. I am concerned that this information is not currently available but I am encouraged that he has taken the matter seriously by doing a security review of appointments which will be made public when completed. I suspect that a number of officials appointed without security vetting were involved in the awarding of corrupt PPE contracts. One of the suspended officials under investigation by the SIU is Ms Thandi Pino, who  was appointed as Chief Director Supply Chain Management in March this year without a security clearance “because the department is in a process to procure an agency to conduct vetting”. This was an astonishing admission by Mamabolo in an earlier written reply to my questions. How can it be that the department failed to do the required security vetting for such a key appointment? eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));The lack of security vetting is a symptom of the deep rot in this department where proper procedures have been ignored for many years so that unscrupulous people can benefit. I hope that the review that is being done leads to accountability for the alarming lack of security audits. Issued by Jack Bloom,DA Gauteng Shadow MEC for Health, 4 November 2020
