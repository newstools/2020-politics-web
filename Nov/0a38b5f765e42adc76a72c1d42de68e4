Matric exam leak: DA calls on Motshekga to make Ministerial Statement in Parlaiment 16 November 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) calls on the Minister of Basic Education, Angie Motshekga, to make a Ministerial Statement at the next sitting of the National Assembly to provide feedback on the scale of the leak of a Mathematics Matric exam paper in Limpopo and Gauteng, as well as the latest updates on the investigations into the matter. This leak will cast a massive cloud over the integrity of the exam process and both learners and parents need assurances that the examinations will be beyond reproach, and that no further exam papers will be leaked going forward. The DA is pleased by the Department’s quick response in initiating an investigation in trying to get to the bottom of this leak. In a statement, the department indicated that "Matric learners in Limpopo and Gauteng appear to have seen the paper prior to being taken this morning". The Minister should also needs to provide feedback on the action that will be taken against implicated learners. We urge Minister Motshekga to heed to our call for a Ministerial Statement in Parliament to ensure the integrity of the exams and for peace of mind for all Matrics and their parents.
