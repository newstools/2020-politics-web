This means that in some instances, cases could be allocated to the wrong sub-districts. We are working with the sub-districts to clean and verify the data and where errors are picked up locally, cases will be re-allocated to the correct areas. The Western Cape has recorded an additional 12 deaths, bringing the total number of COVID-19 related deaths in the province to 4369. We send our condolences to their loved ones at this time. #CommitToFinish: Premier Winde wishes Western Cape class of 2020 best of luckeval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_5',114,'0','0'])); To all our matriculants who will be writing their final exams this year, I want to wish you the very best as you embark on the final step of your schooling career.
