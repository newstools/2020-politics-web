DA welcomes decision by Judge Zondo to not recuse himself 19 November 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomes the decision of Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo’s to not recuse himself as Chairperson of the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture following a spurious bid by former President Jacob Zuma for his removal. This was just a further desperate attempt by Zuma to undermine and derail the work and proceedings of the Commission. Zuma has constantly said that he wants to have his day in court but each time he has an opportunity to do so, he employs Stalingrad strategies to delay the course of the law in order to evade accountability. If Zuma had his way, the entire Commission of Inquiry would collapse, along with two years’ worth of work and R700 million budget. This is the same tactic he used to delay his fraud and corruption charges over the years. South Africa owes Judge Zondo and the Commission a huge debt of gratitude for the excellent job they are doing to protect the independence, integrity and work of this Commission, despite constant challenges. The DA is in full support of the work done by the Zondo Commission in uncovering the extent of the rot in State institutions that has destroyed our economy and opportunities and services to our people. Time has run out for Zuma. There is no longer anywhere for him to hide.  The law will take its course.
