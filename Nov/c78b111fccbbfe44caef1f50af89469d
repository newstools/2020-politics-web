No proper records kept of sundry payments for emergency procurement during Covid-19 pandemic 22 November 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng is concerned that the Department of Social Development and Provincial Treasury do not have clear lines of communication regarding sundry payments as it relates to emergency procurement during the Covid-19 pandemic. Conflicting information was given to me when I tabled questions for written reply to the MEC for Finance Nomantu Nkomo-Ralehoko regarding Covid-19 funding and procurement. According to the MEC, suppliers for the Department of Social Development for Covid-19 procurement were paid through sundry payments amounting to R825 390 000. In addition, the MEC indicated that the reason for the sundry payment could be obtained from the Department. Further questions were then tabled to the MEC for Social Development, Dr Nomathemba Mokgethi regarding the reasons for the sundry payments. According to MEC Mokgethi, no sundry payments were made for Covid-19 procurement. The conflicting replies are extremely concerning as it indicates that there is no system in place to keep track of goods and services that were procured for use during the Covid-19 pandemic. This clearly indicates that there is an opportunity for fraud and corruption to take place. I will be tabling further questions, to ascertain why Provincial Treasury would indicate that sundry payments were made by the Department of Social Development and why this department has no record of this payment.
