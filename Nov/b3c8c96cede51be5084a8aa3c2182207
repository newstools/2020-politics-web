EFF cancels meeting with Minister Schäfer 18 November 2020 The EFF has cancelled their meeting with me which was scheduled for tomorrow, in which we were supposed to discuss the party’s concerns about Brackenfell High School. Their representatives have said that they are too busy preparing for their protest on Friday to spare even one hour to discuss solutions to what is allegedly the reason for the protest. It is very clear that the EFF is not interested in discussing and resolving their concerns. Their only intent is to intimidate and disrupt schooling, adding more anxiety to our learners who have had an extremely difficult year. We are aware that EFF leaders have been making repeated threats of violence on both social media and on radio. The police are aware of these and are investigating them, according to a meeting I had with General Matakata this morning. However, I urge residents of Brackenfell not to come to the school on Friday, except for parents taking their children to school and fetching them. The EFF desperately wants a confrontation outside the school. Do not give in to their tactics. SAPS and other law enforcement authorities are making extensive preparations. Please, let us not give the EFF the attention and confrontation they are so desperately seeking. The PAC protest near the school this morning did not disrupt teaching and learning in any way. The matric exam for the morning had already been completed.
