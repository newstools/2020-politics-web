DA asks Institute of Chartered Accountants to probe Yakhe Kwinana 11 November 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) has written to South African Institute of Chartered Accountants (SAICA) to request an investigation into the alleged malfeasance by Yakhe Kwinana that has been exposed over the past week during hearings of the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture. During the Myeni and Zuma era Kwinana held lucrative board positions at South African Airways (SAA) and SAA Technical (SAAT). At SAAT Kwinana was the Chair of the Board and at SAA she was a Board member and Chair of the SAA Audit Committee. Kwinana’s performance at the Zondo Commission was appalling and was a clear indication that she was not a suitable person to be a member of a profession such as being a qualified CA(SA) and thus a member of SAICA. Kwinana has been accused of the following: Having a conflict of interest in terms of her business relationship with VuyoNdzeku from whom she received R4.2 million; Soliciting a bribe from AAR Corporation which was in line to be awarded a R1.2 billion SAAT supplier contract; Stated that she didn’t know that she had approved a R1 billion SAA contract with Swissport; Was accused by Kate Hofmeyr, the evidence leader, of being a dishonest witness. Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo: Implied that Kwinana was lying when he said of Kwinana’s statement that she did not have the whole set of documents and retorted “That can’t be true”; Expressed incredulity that Kwinana, as a qualified CA, did not know the meaning of “domicilium”. We urge the SAICA to investigate Kwinana’s conduct as she seemingly played a pivotal role in the ANC capture of SAA and SAA’s destruction and bankruptcy and must be held accountable for her part in this mess.
