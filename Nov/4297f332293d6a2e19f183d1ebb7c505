DA rejects proposal by ANC to extend NLC Chairperson’s tenure 25 November 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) rejects the attempt by the ANC at Tuesday’s Portfolio Committee on Trade and Industry to extend scandal-ridden, Alfred Nevuthanda’s tenure as Chairperson of the National Lotteries Commission (NLC) by a further 3 months. This comes after both Parliament and the DA’s legal opinions found that the process followed by Minister Ebrahim Patel to shortlist candidates for the position of NLC Chairperson – would have been unlawful. Not only will this result in a delay in the appointment of a new Chairperson but this means that the NLC will be without a Chairperson by virtue of the fact that Nevuthanda’s term expires on 1 December 2020. The Hawks Serious Economic Offences Unit and the Presidency’s Special Investigative Unit are currently investigating several projects that were granted funds during Nevuthanda’s tenure – which has resulted in massive public outcry. In addition, the Portfolio Committee was told by Parliament’s legal advisor that there was no provision in the Lotteries Act of 1997 to allow for any further extension of his term to take place. It is clear that this attempt may have been and attempt by the ANC to allow Nevuthanda and his fellow travellers an opportunity to destroy critical evidence that may lead to future prosecutions. The DA will not allow for this to happen and is ready to approach the courts if Minister Patel opts for this course of action. Therefore, we call on him to appoint an independent caretaker chairperson until the process to select a new chairperson is concluded.
