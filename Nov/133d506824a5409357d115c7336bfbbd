DA deeply saddened as Estcourt horror crash kills 14 minibus passengers 10 November 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[468,60],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));The Democratic Alliance (DA) in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) is deeply saddened by yet another horrific crash in the province which has claimed the lives of 14 people. According to reports, the incident, which involved a minibus taxi and two trucks, took place on the N3 near Estcourt on Monday night. The victims are believed to include 13 females and one male. At this stage the exact cause of the crash remains unknown. The DA is dismayed by the severe loss of lives on our roads. We extend our most sincere condolences to the families of those who have passed in this most recent incident. With women playing the role of breadwinners and primary caregivers in so many homes, it is deeply saddening that the impact of this devastating incident will undoubtedly be felt for many years to come. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));Since September, a staggering 42 people have lost their lives in KZN as a result of crashes involving minibuses and trucks. The DA has consistently raised the issue of effective policing of our roads with KZN Transport MEC, Bheki Ntuli. We have also called on him to ensure 24-hour visible policing and patrols and urged him to fill the 232 vacant posts that remain within KZN’s Road Traffic Inspectorate (RTI) – both measures which will undoubtedly further assist and compliment efforts by the province’s Department of Transport to ensure increased safety on our roads. To date, the MEC has failed to act. To add to this, when the RTI recently presented its festive season operation plan, it was silent about how it would actually implement the strategy which also aims to reduce road fatalities in the province by 30%. In fact, the programme was more of a pipe dream than anything else. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));It clear that if MEC Ntuli continues to ignore the key issues which need to be addressed, our province will continue to see reckless driver behaviour and more fatalities, particularly as we approach the holiday season with its increased traffic volumes. It is not too late to deal for the MEC to act. The ball is in his court. If he wants to prevent further loss of life, then he must act immediately.
