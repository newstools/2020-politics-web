City suspends Metro Police Officers with immediate effect 19 November 2020 Following a video that was shared on social media this morning regarding an incident involving two City of Cape Town Metro Police officers and a member of the public in a wheelchair, I immediately discussed the matter with the Cityâ€™s Safety and Security Executive Director, Richard Bosman, who confirmed that both officers have been suspended with immediate effect pending the outcome of a full investigation. I want to apologise unreservedly to the member of the public, whose name is not yet known to me, for what he experienced this morning. The manner in which this situation was handled is not what we expect from our staff. Issued by Greg Wagner, Spokesperson to the Executive Mayor, 19 November 2020 This is unacceptable from the Metro Police. This is not the way to treat people ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ pic.twitter.com/9XolQpAzyd
