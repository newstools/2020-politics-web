This year’s theme is “Hate Speech, Social Media and Minorities”. AfriForum’s Head of Policy and Action, Ernst Roets, will do a presentation via video feed on hate speech against minorities in South Africa. “AfriForum appreciates the opportunity to have access to an international stage to bring attention to the persistent issue of hate speech against minorities in South Africa on social media and from high-profile politicians. As a civil rights organisation which focuses largely on minority rights, it is our responsibility to use every avenue possible in order to spread awareness about such issues,” says Roets. AfriForum will also be releasing a video tomorrow about hate speech against minorities in South Africa in order to further bolster its campaign to spread awareness both domestically and abroad.
