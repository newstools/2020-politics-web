DA calls on DBE to provide update on the source of Matric exam leak 23 November 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) calls on the Department of Basic Education (DBE) to provide a progress update on the investigation into the leaked Mathematics Matric exam paper. In particular, regarding the source of the leak. It is vital that we know where this leak originated from to prevent this from happening again. It will also give assurance to both parents and learners that the DBE is on top of this situation. Preliminary investigations have revealed that further provinces, including Mpumalanga, Eastern Cape, North West, Western Cape, Northern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal, have also been affected by the leak, in addition to the leaks initially reported in Gauteng and Limpopo. This leak has cast a massive cloud over the integrity of the Matric exam process and to ensure that the rest of the exams are beyond reproach we need to know how this leak originated to prevent similar leaks in the future. The Class of 2020 has already had an incredibly challenging academic year, and this leak has no doubt lead to further anxiety for Matrics on how it will impact the rest of the examination going forward.
