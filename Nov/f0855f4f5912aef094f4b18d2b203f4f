Response to Helen Zille 25 November 2020 After reading that excuse of a statement which I can only call a desperate attempt by yourself to blame the media and the reportage for the DA’s dwindling electoral support, I had no choice but to respond in kind. Helen, you speak on matters you know nothing about with conviction. Laughable. You were suspended from party activities yourself for your colonialism tweets when the screenshot case was unfolding. Just like how the investigating officer relied on one sided information for his report and final recommendation to charge, you got everything that you wrote in that statement from the same people that wanted me out of the DA so badly that they’d  even frame me for something I did not do. As tempting as it is to go into details and unpack these things for you, I won’t. Both the screenshot case and the sexual assault matter are sub Judice. I’ll still exercise the same patience I exercised for two years when I was called all sorts of names while the screenshot case was ongoing. I know my truth and you will not change it. The DA is dying, Helen and you are killing it with your arrogance. P. S. next time, write to me directly.
