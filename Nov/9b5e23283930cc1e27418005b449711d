Voters are increasingly turning to the FF Plus – also on municipal level 12 November 2020 The results of various municipal by-elections that took place across the country yesterday confirm the tendency established in last year's national elections and the local by-elections that took place since as it is clear that voters are increasingly turning to the FF Plus as an alternative to the DA. Yesterday in Ward 5 in the JB Marks Municipality (Potchefstroom), the FF Plus delivered a tour de force as it received 58,86% of the total number of votes, compared to 17,6% in 2016. That is an increase of 41,26%. In Ward 18 of the Emalahleni Local Municipality (Witbank), the FF Plus grew from 3% in 2016 to 31% of the total number of votes cast. The party's steady growth was also maintained in other provinces. In Ward 3 in Drakenstein in Paarl (Western Cape), support for the party grew with more than 10% and with approximately 8% in Ward 2 in Knysna. In Phokwane in the Northern Cape, the FF Plus obtained representation in the municipal council for the first time. The FF Plus also expanded its support in the Renosterberg Municipality. In Ward 2 (Margate) of the Ray Nkonyeni Municipality, support for the FF Plus grew from 3% in 2016 to 8% yesterday. The FF Plus's growth, which was established on national level with the 2019 general elections, has since been cemented in various municipal elections where the party showed phenomenal growth in some cases. In January this year, the number of votes for the party in Ward 9 of the Mamusa Municipality (Schweizer-Reneke) increased with 87,5% compared to the 2016 municipal elections, while the DA lost 65% of its votes. In September 2019, the FF Plus also won Ward 2 in the JB Marks Municipality (Potchefstroom) from the DA. eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_3',115,'0','0']));Votes for the FF Plus in that ward increased with 56% since the 2016 municipal elections, while the DA lost 65% of its votes. In July last year with the by-elections in Ward 30 of the Matlosana Local Municipality (Stilfontein), the FF Plus received 56% of all the votes cast, which was more votes than all four the other parties’ combined. It is becoming abundantly clear that voters are voting in favour of better service delivery and strong opposition to the ANC. The FF Plus has a message of real hope for the future. Yesterday's results show that the FF Plus is considered the growing alternative and this is backed by the faith voters have demonstrated in the party. The FF Plus truly listens to its voters and takes decisive action on their behalf. Issued by Pieter Groenewald, FF Plus leader, 12 November 2020
