This is an extremely serious development for both the ANC, and our whole South African community. MKMVA will in due course respond with a comprehensive statement. As MKMVA we warned many times against the selective use of corruption charges and the law enforcement agencies as tools for factional targeting and political infighting causes disunity in the African National Congress (ANC) and overall in our country. It is also fundamentally disrespectful of our Constution and the rule of law in general.
