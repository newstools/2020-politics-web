MEDIA STATEMENT Dimension Data Middle East & Africa (MEA) rejects any accusation that its legal dispute with its former Executive Chairman of 12-years, Mr Andile Ngcaba is as a result of alleged racism. There are a number of factual inaccuracies and unfounded accusations that call for comment: This dispute relates to equal pay: His complaint is that he was not the highest paid person at Dimension Data MEA. This compliant is without merit. In his 12-year tenure at Dimension Data MEA, he received (directly and indirectly) in excess of R500m. This is significantly more than the amounts received by any other executives of Dimension Data MEA over that period. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_3',113,'0','0']));This issue is racist in its behaviour: We are alarmed that Mr Ngcaba would allege institutional racism in an organisation that he led for 12 years, especially given that he had a fiduciary duty and legal obligation to oversee issues of governance, transformation and remuneration across the entire Dimension Data MEA organisation. This duty extended not only to his personal interests but also to the interests of all Dimension Data MEA employees. During that time Mr Ngcaba was Executive Chairman and a member of the Remuneration Committee and was privy to all salary related information at all levels of the organisation. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_4',114,'0','0']));At no point in his 12-year tenure did Mr Ngcaba raise any of the issues about which he now complains. If there had been institutional racism in any form, one would have expected him to have addressed this during his tenure, in the interest of all employees. Dimension Data is an ethical and values-led organisation and will continue to act appropriately. We will never tolerate any incidence of racism and discrimination in our company and society. The action against Dimension Data is being defended. Statement issued by Dimension Data, 6 November 2020eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_0',115,'0','0']));
