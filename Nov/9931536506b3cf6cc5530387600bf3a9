Committee report denouncing corruption unanimously adopted by the National Assembly 4 November 2020 The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on International Relations and Cooperation, Ms Tandi Mahambehlala, tabled the committee’s oversight report to two South African Missions in New York for adoption in the National Assembly yesterday. Ms Mahambehlala was overwhelmed with gratitude by the manner in which the committee report was received. She had this to say: “On behalf of the Portfolio Committee, I wish to express my appreciation for the manner in which committee members supported the balanced oversight report without hesitation. “This translated into a rare moment in the House, where all members stood up in defence of their oversight efforts. Thank you for your unwavering support and cooperation on this report. At the end of the day it is a true reflection of what transpired in New York, and it reflects your decisive parameters as to what the department needs to do to address the issues raised. “It is important to restore this trust internationally. It was only befitting that we, as Parliament of South Africa, were seen to be having zero tolerance to corruption. Hence our oversight stance to deal head-on with suspected corruption wherever it occurs. “We should also pride ourselves that this oversight of revelations against corruption came about within our first 100 days of oversight. This is remarkable even from the positive reaction we got from the House. “What it means to the committee is that it should be even more resolute to advocate for the review of the parliamentary oversight model, to enable the committee to do its work. It should be able to conduct oversight to other embassies of South Africa to deal with the root causes of negative audit outcomes in the department.” Issued by Sibongile Maputi, Media Officer, Parliamentary Communication Services, 4 November 2020
