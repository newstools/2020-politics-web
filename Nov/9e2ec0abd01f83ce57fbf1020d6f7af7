DA Gauteng Election Results 14 November 2020 We are delighted to announce the results of the leadership elections which took place at the Democratic Alliance (DA) Gauteng Virtual Provincial Congress 2020 today. The new leadership team has received a huge mandate to take the party forward and will seek to regain lost ground and go beyond by unseating the African National Congress in Gauteng.

This congress was the largest virtual and participatory congress in Gauteng. We thank all delegates for their participation and their compliance with the rules of our internal democracy, which remains healthy, strong and vibrant. The results of the elections are: Provincial Leader Solly Msimanga (75% ) Provincial Chairperson Fred Nel ( 67%) Deputy Provincial Chairperson Bongani Nkomo We extend our congratulations to all elected candidates as we enter an exciting new chapter of Achieving Real Growth in Gauteng.
