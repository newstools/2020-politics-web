SACP supports measures to contain resurgence of COVID-19 clusters 11 November 2020 The SACP has noted President Cyril Ramaphosaâ€™s address to the nation on Wednesday evening, 11 November 2020. We share the concern expressed by the President. As soon as COVID-19 alert was lowered to Level 1, increasingly certain sections of our society shifted to activities without protective measures to prevent the spread of the deadly virus. The SACP calls upon all the people in South Africa to take part in protecting the right to life and contribute to the much-needed success against COVID-19. We welcome the measures announced by the President to contain the resurgence of COVID-19 clusters in the Eastern Cape, the Garden Route, Free State, and other areas that require urgent attention. Engagement on economic reconstruction and recovery programme remains essential to overcome the total damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the chronic economic crisis before the crisis. The damage includes the 2.2 million jobs lost in the second quarter of 2020. Statistics South Africa is yet to release its Quarterly Labour Force Survey for the third quarter. However, all indications suggest more jobs were lost and unemployment increased. Also, poverty and inequality worsened.
