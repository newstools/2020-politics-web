Electoral Commission on provisional results of by-elections held on 11 November 2020 12 Nov 2020 Introduction:eval(ez_write_tag([[468,60],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0'])); The Electoral Commission is pleased with the successful holding of by-elections across 55 municipalities in all nine provinces yesterday which were overwhelmingly calm, peaceful and smooth. These elections were extraordinary in that they were the first to be held in South Africa under COVID-19 conditions and were the largest number of by-elections held on a single day in our history. The Commission is also encouraged by the turnout of voters which is within the range for by-elections held since the 2016 Municipal Elections. The average turnout yesterday was 37.83 percent compared to an average of 38.73 percent over the past four years. The highest turnout recorded yesterday was 75.29 percent which was recorded in ward 4 of the Port St Johns municipality in the Eastern Cape.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_5',113,'0','0'])); Given the fact this was the first elections conducted during COVID-19, that election day was a normal working day and given the inclement weather in many parts of the country especially in KwaZulu-Natal, the success of the elections bodes well for the upcoming Municipal Elections scheduled for 2021. The Electoral Commission wishes to express its gratitude to those voters who came out to vote and for following the COVID-19 protocols strictly and without complaint We also express our thanks to the political parties, their candidates and agents for their support, cooperation and contribution to the success of these by-elections. Thanks must also be extended to the South African Police Services (SAPS) for being a constantly dependable partner in the delivery of safe and peaceful elections. The Commission wishes to express its gratitude to the Electoral Court for providing judicial clarity and condonation to conduct these elections outside of the 90-day period. Finally, our gratitude goes to the media for generating extraordinary interest in these by-elections. Community protests: Despite the overwhelmingly smooth, calm and peaceful conducting of by-elections yesterday, the Commission is saddened and concerned by the disruptions caused to voting procedures earlier in the day in two wards. The opening of voting stations was significantly delayed in ward 130 (Naledi, Soweto) in the City of Johannesburg and at one voting station in ward 13 in Amahlathi Municipality in the Eastern Cape. Protests over service delivery targeted voting stations in these areas including blocking the access to voting stations of both election officials and voters. Through the intervention of the SAPS along with provincial and municipal leaders, voting was able to finally get underway at around midday. The Commission supports the right of communities to protest peacefully in a manner that does not infringe on the rights of citizens to vote and to voice their views through democratic processes.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-banner-1','ezslot_2',116,'0','0'])); The Commission is grateful for the swift intervention of the SAPS and interventions by community and political leaders to resolve these situations. The Commission calls on the SAPS to take decisive action against anyone whose actions impeded the holding of free and fair elections. The Commission calls on leaders from political parties, community structures, religious and civic organisations along with traditional authorities to work with the Electoral Commission to ensure that future by-elections and the 2021 Municipal Elections are not disrupted or impacted by protest action.
