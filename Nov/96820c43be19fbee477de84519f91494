This means that in some instances, cases could be allocated to the wrong sub-districts. We are working with the sub-districts to clean and verify the data and where errors are picked up locally, cases will be re-allocated to the correct areas. The Western Cape has recorded 7 additional deaths, bringing the total number of COVID-19 related deaths in the province to 4422. We send our condolences to their loved ones at this time. Making safe, smart decisions this holiday season: As summer and the festive season approach, many people will be going out, socializing and visiting friends and family. By making simple, smart choices we can stay safe, protect our loved ones and ensure that we can enjoy this time, and support businesses. We must move forward- we cannot afford a second lockdown which would result in further job losses and deepen the economic and humanitarian crisis the country currently faces. By taking precautions, and acting responsibly, we can avoid further infections and the potential of a second lockdown. Wear a mask when you leave home, wash your hands regularly, and if you are feeling ill or experiencing any symptoms, stay at home. At work: Being indoors in closed spaces presents a higher risk for spreading of Covid-19. Where you must stay indoors, such as in office environments, ensure that doors and windows are open, keep your mask on and keep a safe distance from others. Elevators are small, confined spaces, so if they are full, take the stairs instead. Always wash or sanitize your hands after touching high-touch surfaces such as elevator buttons and escalator or stair rails. At the shops and in other public spaces: Avoid queues wherever possible. In instances where you must queue, ensure that you are keeping a distance of 1.5 metres. Make use of hand sanitizers available at the entrances of shops and businesses, and disinfectant wipes for trolleys and baskets. While you are socializing: If you are entertaining guests at home, keep the gathering small and try to keep it outdoors. If you are serving food, have one person dish up for everyone. We encourage people to go out and support businesses, but to do so in a responsible manner that keeps everyone safe. Open air events are safest, so, consider outdoor opportunities to socialize and see friends and family. Consider the size of the venue- if you cannot maintain a 1.5 metre distance, then consider going somewhere else. If someone stands too close to you, ask them politely to step back. Ensure the venue is well ventilated and has its windows open. If not, ask them to open the windows. If you are eating out, and the option is available ask to be seated outside. Always wear your mask in public and when you aren’t eating or drinking anything. Drink responsibly and do not share drinks, cigarettes, or cutlery. If a venue asks you to fill out an attendance register, please use the correct information and write clearly. This makes it easier to contact you, should we need to do so. Vaccine news: The international news of a potential vaccine is very positive as it represents a breakthrough in the fight against COVID-19. However, we must carefully manage our expectations with regards to a vaccine. This particular vaccine which has been shown to be 90% effective so far, also requires stringent cold chain management and storage, the likes of which are not widely available around the world. Any new vaccine must pass all the relevant international safety standards before being made available for public use. With global demand for a vaccine being high, it would also take some time to produce sufficient dosages and would need to be fairly allocated and distributed. We are grateful for the work being done on vaccines by scientists around the world, and for all those currently taking part in vaccine trials. This latest news is a sure sign that we are moving towards a significant breakthrough- however- until a vaccine is widely available, our strongest defense against Covid-19 is our own behaviour.
