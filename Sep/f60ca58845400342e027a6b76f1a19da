JOINT STATEMENT OF THE EFF AND CLICKS ON THE RACIST IMAGE PUBLISHED BY CLICKS ON ITS WEBSITE Thursday, 10 September 2020 Following the offensive and racist image that was issued by Clicks, the Economic Freedom Fighters held a meeting with Clicks regarding the racist advert that was posted on the Clicks website. The EFF and Clicks agreed that the advert is offensive and racist and Clicks takes full responsibility for the advert distributed on its website. The EFF expressed disappointment to the way Clicks handled the matter in question. The EFF made it clear that the days of apologies and sorry are over and that there must be consequences for racism. Following the constructive and robust discussion between the EFF and Clicks, we have agreed on the following: 1. Clicks expresses its remorse to all South Africans, black women in particular, for the racist Tresemmé SA advert it published on its website. 2. Clicks will withdraw all Tresemmé SA products from all its stores and replace them with locally produced products. 3. In addition, Clicks will donate a minimum of 50 000 sanitary towels (pads), 50 000 sanitizers and masks to rural and informal settlements identified by the EFF. 4. Clicks will award a scholarship to five students to pursue pharmaceutical qualifications in the next academic year (2021). All five must be black, rural, African female and orphaned by HIV and AIDS. 5. The EFF will work with law enforcement agencies to ensure that agent provocateurs involved in the vandalism of Clicks Stores are brought to book. In line with the above. the EFF and Clicks have put the matter in question to rest. We have agreed to hold further discussions on transformation within Clicks relating to procurement, empowerment, employment equity. localization and diversification of supplier base. The EFF calls off all protest action at all Clicks stores with immediate effect. All Clicks stores can now resume normal operations. Statement issued by the EFF, 9 September 2020
