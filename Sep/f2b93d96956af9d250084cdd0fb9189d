EFF CALLS FOR THE CLOSURE OF ALL CLICKS STORES IN SOUTH AFRICA Sunday, 06 September 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_3',112,'0','0']));The Economic Freedom Fighters calls for the closure of all Clicks stores in South Africa in light of their unrepentant and perverse racism. Clicks participated in the public dehumanising of black people through an advert which presented the hair of black women as "damaged" in comparison to white hair which is described as normal, fine and flat. The implications of this are that black identity exists as inferior to the identity of white people. It is an assertion that white standards of beauty are to be aspired to and the features of black people represent damage, decay and abnormality. This characterisation is the founding stone of anti-black racism, and the EFF will not tolerate it. We had written to Clicks with direct demands in order to remedy their racist act and given them a 24-hour deadline to respond. Their response to our letter was nothing short of condescending and revealed a lack of remorse for their attack on the dignity of black people. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0']));We, therefore, call on all Clicks branches to close and must only open on Saturday 12 September. This is because we are of the view that they are not genuine with their apology and the only way to make capitalists apologise and feel genuine remorse is for them to lose money. If Clicks does not close our members in all the branches will shut down all 880 Clicks outlets across the country from Monday 7 September 2020 to Friday 11 September 2020. All members and branches will receive direct communique from their regional and provincial structures on the way forward. Let us wage war on the racist financial sector.
