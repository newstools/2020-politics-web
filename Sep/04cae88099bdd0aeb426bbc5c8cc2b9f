Joint statement of the EFF and Unilever on the Tresemme SA racist image 10 September 2020 Following the offensive and racist image that was issued by Clicks, the Economic Freedom Fighters held a meeting with multinational goods company Unilever regarding the racist advert put out by one of its subsidiary products Tresemmé SA. The EFF and Unilever agreed that the advert is offensive and racist. However, we could not find each other on the publishing of the names of people responsible for the racist image. Moreover, the director involved in the campaign has since left the company and the country. Unilever has made a commitment that following its internal investigations, the necessary disciplinary action will be taken against those remaining in the company in line with its policies. Upon the conclusion of the internal process, Unilever will take the EFF and the country into confidence. Following the robust discussion between the EFF and Unilever, we have agreed on the following: Unilever expresses its remorse to all South Africans, black women in particular, for the racist Tresemmé SA image Unilever will withdraw all Tresemmé SA products from all retail stores for a period of 10 days as a demonstration of its remorse for the offensive and racist image. In addition, Unilever will donate a minimum of 10 000 sanitary towels (pads) and sanitizers to informal settlements identified by the EFF In line with the above, the EFF and Unilever have put the matter in question to rest. We have agreed to hold further discussions on transformation within Unilever relating to procurement. empowerment, employment equity and localization.
