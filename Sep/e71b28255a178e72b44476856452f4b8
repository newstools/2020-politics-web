ANC statement on the release of high demand spectrum by ICASA 7 September 2020  The African National Congress (ANC) applauds and welcomes the recent announcement by the newly appointed council of the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) that it will release the Invitation To Apply (ITA) for the 4G and 5G high demand spectrum by the end of September 2020. The regulator has committed to release two ITA's, notably the new Wireless Open Access (WOAN) and the Auctioning of Spectrum which will occur under strict timelines between December 2020 and March 2021. The release of high demand spectrum is critical to unlock the much-needed investment in the economy and must also address the also address the objectives of the Electronic Communications Act such as the promotion of effective competition in the sector and the ownership of productive ICT assets by women, youth and Black people. The ANC expects that the operators who will be awarded the spectrum will have unencumbered 30% direct ownership by Historically Disadvantaged Persons. This should be non-negotiable. As it hits the ground running the ICASA council must also ensure that the Wireless Open Access Network (WOAN) is not a white elephant and is empowered to promote effective competition. The ANC believes that spectrum licensing will provide the much needed investment in infrastructure for 5G technology deployment, and advance South Africa's acceleration of the Fourth Industrial Revolution which is anchored on a working digital economy.
