Licence Renewals: MEC must stop giving KZN motorists the silent treatment  23 September 2020eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0'])); The Democratic Alliance (DA) in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) today calls on Transport MEC, Bheki Ntuli, to come out of hiding and urgently address the issue of motorists in the province being charged penalties as a result of late licence renewals. This after a waiver for motor vehicle licence discs, temporary permits and roadworthy certificates expired on 31 August and while the deadlines for various other licences looms. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));The situation that KZN’s motorists now find themselves in is a direct result of KZN’s Department of Transport (DoT) being unable to cope with the backlog created by the Covid-19 lockdown. It also comes as a result of constant disruptions since the re-opening of Driver Licence Testing Centres (DLTCs) in the province. Since the re-opening of DLTCs, limited daily quotas for the number of people to be assisted have been implemented. In some cases, centres have also been closed for up to a week at a time, leaving people unable to renew licences. The fees being charged are also highly irregular given a directive from the Disaster Management Act. According the last amended regulation; eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));- All learner's licences, driving licence cards, temporary driving licences and professional driving permits that expired during the period that commenced from 26 March 2020 up to and including 31 August 2020 are deemed to be valid and their validity period is extended for a further grace period ending on 31 January 2021 - All motor vehicle licence discs, temporary permits and roadworthy certificates that expire during the period that commenced from 26 March 2020 up to and including 31 May 2020 are deemed to be valid and their validity period is extended for a further grace period ending on 31 August 2020 and; 1. Motor trade number licences that expired during the period that commenced from 26 March 2020 up to and including 31 May 2020 are deemed to be valid and are extended for a further grace period ending on 30 November 2020. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_8',115,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_9',115,'0','1']));Despite these very clear directives, MEC Ntuli has remained silent. This, while motorists continue to be punished for something which is not of their making. Nor has he taken up the issue of waivers and further extensions with the national Minister of Transport. It is clear that the DoT did not take any measures to ensure a proper plan to deal with backlogs after lockdown. The DA expects MEC Ntuli to come out of hiding and address these key concerns. He must immediately investigate the penalties being charged and address the issue of a waiver on vehicle licence renewals with immediate effect. A further extension on renewals must also be urgently considered and raised with the national Minister of Transport. It is unacceptable that motorists in our province should have to bear the brunt of the Department’s ongoing incompetence. Issued by Sharon Hoosen, DA KZN Spokesperson on Transport, 23 September 2020
