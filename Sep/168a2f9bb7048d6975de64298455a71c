The advert, asserts visually and descriptively the natural hair of black women is damaged and dull while depicting the hair of white women as normal, fine and flat. It is inexplicable that this imagery can be portrayed, one which reinforces the racist narrative of the abnormality of blackness as opposed to whiteness as a standard. Anti-black racism through the use of the politics of hair has been a benchmark of discrimination against black people across society and through various oppressive histories. In apartheid South Africa, the infamous pencil test was used to classify races, and when the pencil did not slip through hair, in a manner that it does in what is defined as "normal" and "fine" hair, this was a measure of concluding that one was part of the inferior black race. In many historically white primary and high schools today, children are suspended, expelled and barred from writing their examinations on the basis of having "untidy" and supposedly "unkempt" hair, these labels are ascribed to black children who have Afro's, braids and various hairstyles which are common to black communities. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));The transgression that Clicks has made goes far beyond a simple advert; rather, it represents a cornerstone of anti-black racism which manifests itself through the disregarding of black identity. It is part of a long history of making the features of black people abnormal, insufficient and uncivilised while presenting the white identity and features of white people as the standard for humanness and humanity. Clicks must therefore be regarded as having committed a human rights violation in this regard because their advert is a perpetuation of the violence of colonialism and racism. All progressive forces must embark on direct action to ensure Clicks is held accountable for their racism, and this is not brushed under the carpet like many violations black people are confronted with in this country. We are the black majority & should NEVER, EVER accept racism in any form. Our hair, our skin & our bodies, in our country & the world, MUST be respected, BY ANY REVOLUTIONARY MEANS NECESSARY! Blacks should go to Clicks & get their Justice, to hell with Reconciliation & Apologies! pic.twitter.com/fqbrcvMmpI Text of the letter: eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_5',114,'0','0']));OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY GENERAL CLICKS GROUP LIMITED ART MR VIKESH RAMSUNDER (CEO) eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_0',115,'0','0']));14 TAMAR AVENUE, LEAGLEN, RANDBURG, 1709 Per email eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-banner-1','ezslot_4',116,'0','0']));04 September 2020 Dear MR VIKESH RAMSUNDER, RE: URGENT DEMANDS IN RESPECT OF YOUR RACIST ADVERT 1.
