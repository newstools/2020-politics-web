Media statement with respect to health and beauty retail store Clicks 7 September 2020 The South African Human Rights Commission (Commission) has noted with concern an advert by health and beauty retail store Clicks. The advert, for hair products, seemingly suggests that African hair is amongst others “dry and damaged”. To this effect, the Commission has launched an own-initiative investigation into this matter. The Commission has further written a letter to and called for a meeting with Clicks, for the retail store to explain itself concerning the content of the advert. The Commission has also noted an apology from Clicks’ Group CEO, Vikesh Ramsunder, noting the company’s disappointment at this advert and the hurt caused by it. The Commission remains committed to understanding measures taken by Clicks to guard against such adverts in the future and other accountability and sensitivity measures the company intends to take going forward. The Commission has also noted that the advert by Clicks has elicited strong emotions and protests from the general public. The Commission supports the right to protest as envisaged in section 17 of the Constitution, and calls for South Africans to exercise this right in a peaceful manner.
