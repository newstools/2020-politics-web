DA submits parliamentary questions to ascertain full backgrounds and criminal records of cops involved in Nathaniel Julies murder 29 September 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) will submit parliamentary questions to the South African Police Services (SAPS) to ascertain the criminal records and full backgrounds of all three police officers involved in the tragic murder of Nathaniel Julies. This follows reports that one of the officers involved in the case has three previous criminal convictions, including assault, assault to cause grievous bodily harm, and malicious damage to property. This is highly problematic because the law dictates that someone with a criminal record is not eligible to become a police officer. This once again demonstrates the failure in SAPS to properly vet and detect criminal records of new recruits. It casts a dark cloud over the integrity of the SAPS when they have convicted violent offenders within their ranks. It not only compromises the fight against violent crime in South Africa, but it creates the unfortunate conditions for police brutality flourish. We have seen over this lockdown period how the police and other law enforcement officials violently cracked down on South Africans for simply surfing or sitting in their own front yards. And in the case of Nathaniel, for simply eating a biscuit. To avoid incidents like Nathaniel’s untimely murder from ever happening again at the hands of police, the DA is of the view that SAPS members must be properly vetted during their recruitment process. This will also ensure that the police’s ability to effectively fight crime is not hindered. The DA reiterates our call for an overhaul and professionalisation of SAPS and for the removal of criminal cops to ensure the safety of all South Africans in their homes and on the streets.
