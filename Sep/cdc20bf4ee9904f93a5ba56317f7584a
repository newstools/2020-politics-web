EFF welcomes dismissal of racist Clicks court application 7 September 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0']));The Economic Freedom Fighters welcomes the dismissal of racist Clicks SA's court application to stop protests against their unrepentant racism. The application by Clicks was dismissed due to being defective, with costs, and as the EFF, we are vindicated that their arrogance was dealt with harshly by a court of law. Clicks made an irrational and silly attempt to prevent the EFF from practising its constitutional right to protest. Their approach to the courts was nothing but a waste of time of our judiciary at a time when it has far more important matters before it. Clicks can no longer avoid accountability for their assertion that the identity of black people is inferior to that of white people and we will continue to protest peacefully across the country ensuring no Clicks store operates until our demands are met over the next five days. The commitment Clicks has shown to protecting racists and defending racism will come at significant cost to their own profits. As the EFF, we have made simple demands, such as the company that produced the racist advert depicting black women's hair as inferior to white people to be fired, for a list of all those who were involved in the campaign to be released to the public and for them to be fired. Instead of doing this, Clicks arrogantly pronounces that its operations would continue at the expense of the dignity of black people. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0']));Their racism will cost them harshly, and the EFF will ensure no Clicks store operates for the next five days unless our demands are met. We will continue our peaceful protests, and we condemn any, and all violence meted out on Clicks. This is in no way associated with the EFF as our protest action is conducted peacefully and lawfully. The Queenstown incident has been brought to our attention, and we have dealt with it swiftly and accordingly. We call on all members of the public to alert the EFF through its social media platforms should they encounter any Clicks store which is operational. We will swiftly deploy our members to assist them in shutting down until Clicks learns that racism will not be tolerated in this country.
