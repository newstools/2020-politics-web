DPE finalising funding for SAA restructuring process 18 September 2020 The DPE confirms that government will reprioritize funds to finalise the restructuring of South African Airways (SAA) and the implementation of the airline’s business rescue plan. An announcement to this effect will be announced in the Adjustments Appropriation Bill, which will be introduced in Parliament soon. The national carrier will not be liquidated. Because the restructuring process should be brought closer to finalisation in the next few weeks, lending institutions will be requested to finance the restructuring process and honour commitments for voluntary severance packages and retrenchments. At the same time the DPE will continue to assess the 20 unsolicited expressions of interests from private sector funders, private equity investors and partners for a future restructured SAA. The DPE is sympathetic to the plight of SAA employees while continuing to work with other government departments, including the National Treasury, to make sure that the airline’s restructuring plan will be successfully implemented. In charting the way forward, the DPE believes the key to solving the difficulties facing SAA, is the finalisation and implementation of the business rescue process, followed by the start of a restructured airline, appointment of new non-executive directors and leadership team and securing a credible strategic equity partner who can introduce the required technical, financial, and operational expertise into the business.
