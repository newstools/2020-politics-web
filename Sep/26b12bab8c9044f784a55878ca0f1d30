Nelson Mandela Foundation responds to alleged comments from President Trump on Nelson Mandela Monday 7 September 2020 The Nelson Mandela Foundation has noted the statements attributed to the US President Donald Trump about African leaders in general and Nelson Mandela in particular, in a book by Michael Cohen titled Disloyal. eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0'])); We do not believe that leaders who conduct themselves in the way Mr Trump does are in a position to offer authoritative commentary on the life and work of Madiba. Reflecting on leadership, Madiba once said: “A good leader can engage in a debate frankly and thoroughly, knowing that at the end he and the other side must be closer, and thus emerge stronger. You don't have that idea when you are arrogant, superficial, and uninformed.” We would recommend these words to Mr Trump for consideration.
