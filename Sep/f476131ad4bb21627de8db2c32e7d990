The "Good" party makes a bad decision on Meiring 28 September 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) notes that former DA Councillor in the City of Ekurhuleni Jacques Meiring participated in a Good Party press conference yesterday where he announced his new political home. In this respect he has automatically terminated his membership. On our part, we are of the view that the Good Party has made a bad decision on accepting him. Meiring, in moving to the Good party, is running away from facing very serious charges relating to financial mismanagement instituted by the DA’s Federal Legal Commission (FLC). It must be mentioned that he had been suspended from Caucus as well as party duties, due to the severity of the disciplinary investigation. The proceedings were to be heard in the near future. It is clear that Meiring preferred to leave, choosing to avoid the formal disciplinary hearing. Issued by Solly Msimanga, DA Gauteng Interim Leader, 28 September 2020
