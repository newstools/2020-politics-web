This means that in some instances, cases could be allocated to the wrong sub-districts. We are working with the sub-districts to clean and verify the data and where errors are picked up locally, cases will be re-allocated to the correct areas. The Western Cape has recorded an additional 7 deaths, bringing the total number of COVID-19 related deaths in the province to 4106. We send our condolences to their family and friends at this time. Move to alert level 1:eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_4',114,'0','0'])); Earlier this week, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that the country will move to alert level one at midnight on Sunday. The Western Cape Government welcomes the move, which will create more economic activity and help to save jobs but we must do this safely to ensure that we are able to stay safe while moving forward. This will require each and every one of us to wear our masks, wash our hands and practice social distancing and for every business to comply with the safety regulations which are in place. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_3',115,'0','0']));We note that the regulations were gazetted today and will be studying them in detail. The move to level one must not be seen as a chance to let our guard's down- but rather an opportunity to begin rebuilding our economy and to help those businesses which have been severely impacted by months of lockdown and restrictions. I therefore encourage all those who are able to, to support a local business- whether it be buying your fruit and vegetables from a local vendor or market, buying locally produced clothing or crafts, making use of a local service provider or artisan or taking a trip to your favorite Western Cape destination. Over the past six months, we have watched South Africans stand together to fight this virus and we have seen the impact of what a combined and concerted effort can do. We must direct the same energy towards ensuring that we are able to save jobs and prevent the second pandemic of unemployment and avert a humanitarian crisis.
