Response to Solly Msimanga 30 September 2020 In a recent statement DA Gauteng Leader, Solly Msimanga, claimed there was a Federal Legal Commission(FLC) investigation into me based on money owed to Aerocom for computers and internet installed supplied to the DA in early 2018. I would like to state the facts and set the record straight. I have served the DA as a ward councillor from August 2016 until Sunday, 27 September 2020. Over the past four years I have never been charged by the DA's Federal Legal Commission. Suddenly, now that I have resigned, the DA claims I was facing disciplinary charges from the FLC. It is easy for all to see why DA Federal Leader Candidate, Mbali Ntuli, claims that the DA's Federal Legal Commission has become weaponised. These so-called FLC charges, like in the case of many others who have left the DA, suddenly surface after I resigned and 2 years after the event they are trying to link me to. If I had done something wrong in 2018 they should have charged me for it then. This claim is a lame attempt by the DA to discredit me and my reputation. I have never received any communication relating to financial mismanagement instituted by the DA's Federal Legal Commission (FLC). I did receive a phone call asking if I will avail myself to a meeting to discuss the matter but have not received a reply as to a date or venue for such meeting. Whilst Aerocom is suing the DA for payment, this matter is between the DA and Aerocom. In fact the DA is defending Aerocom's lawsuit and I was to testify, as a witness on behalf of the DA, in this civil dispute. The DA is an old dying party still clinging to the same old dirty tricks. But the rest of us have moved on. Regards Jacques Meiring
