Tshwane ANC Administrators unlawfully appoint waste contractors 23 September 2020 The ANC's unlawful administrators in Tshwane are set to incur millions of rands in irregular expenditure after unlawfully appointing waste collectors in a scramble to address the City’s growing waste crisis. The waste collection contractors are currently clearing rubbish without any proper purchasing orders in place and no detailed terms of service. They are essentially operating with a blank cheque from the ANC administrators who have failed to follow due process in ensuring that they are lawfully appointed through adequate supply chain processes. Furthermore, there are no mechanisms in place to assess the quality of service they are providing nor to scrutinise the results. The unlawful ANC administrators had six weeks to ensure that a proper tender was in place. Due to their botched management of the original tendering process they have unlawfully appointed contractors to step in. As a result the ANC administrators will likely incur millions of rand in irregular expenditure to hide their incompetence. They have completely abandoned supply chain processes as could be seen in the debacle surrounding the appointment of social relief providers who are trying to claim an estimated R20 million back from the City. All supply chain contracts that exceed R200 000 in the City must have their details made publicly available. The DA calls on the unlawful ANC administrators to release all the details that pertain to the waste management contracts in the City. Failure to do so will lead us to file an application in terms of the Promotion of Access of Information Act to compel the unlawful ANC administrators in Tshwane to release all the information that pertains to the appointment of waste contractors in the City.
