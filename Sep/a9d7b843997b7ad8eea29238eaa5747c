This means that in some instances, cases could be allocated to the wrong sub-districts. We are working with the sub-districts to clean and verify the data and where errors are picked up locally, cases will be re-allocated to the correct areas. More data is available here: https://coronavirus.westerncape.gov.za/covid-19-dashboard eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_4',114,'0','0']));The Western Cape has recorded an additional 9 deaths, bringing the total number of COVID-19 related deaths in the province to 3970. We send our condolences to their family and friends at this time. Continued decline in case numbers in alert level 2: The Western Cape continues to record promising signs of decline in hospitalisations (which have dropped below the 700 mark), test positivity rate and deaths in the province. These are positive signs that the Western Cape's management of the virus through our healthcare and hotspot interventions, as well as the continued vigilance of our residents, is paying off. These indicators show that three weeks into alert level 2, with more businesses open, more people returning to their workplaces and more people moving around, there has not been an uptick in new cases. With the appropriate safety measures in place, we can reopen further, and save jobs while also saving lives. There are, as yet, no tools that can indicate whether we will see a resurgence in the virus, or when. We continue to track the numbers and all of the indicators available to us closely as we monitor the situation. The Department of Health in the Western Cape is involved in various surveillance studies which allows us to use data to manage and monitor the virus. We encourage residents of the Western Cape to go out and to support businesses wherever they can but to do so safely. In the absence of a vaccine, behaviour change is the most powerful weapon that we have against COVID-19. Residents can play their part by: -Wearing a clean mask when you are outside of your home. This mask must be worn correctly, covering your nose and mouth, and must be put on and removed safely. eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-banner-1','ezslot_1',116,'0','0']));-Regular handwashing with soap and water or hand sanitizers. This remains an important infection control mechanism against a number of illnesses and should be a part of all of our daily routines. -Keeping a distance of 1.5 metres between yourself and any other person. As we all leave our homes more, this will become even more important in queues, in shops, public places and in work spaces. -Surface hygiene and regular wiping of high traffic surfaces such as counter tops, door handles, light switches, elevator buttons and other shared surfaces remains important. -If you must cough and sneeze, do so into a tissue which you can throw away, or into your elbow. -If you are not feeling well, the best thing you can do for your own health and the health of those around you, is to stay at home.
