Hearing date set for armed forces officer spreading HIV 16 September 2020 The hearing of the former armed forces officer that intentionally infected a fellow member of the armed forces with HIV and is now charged with attempted murder, will begin on 27 January 2021. AfriForum’s Private Prosecution Unit is currently supporting the victim. The accused again appeared in court today to obtain a copy of the docket in the case against him. His legal representative argued that he is not available for the remainder of the year and needs time to study the docket. AfriForum’s Private Prosecution Unit became involved in this case in 2018 after a member of the media approached the unit for assistance. After consultation with the prosecutor, the unit learned that the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) failed to supply the necessary information to the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). After continuous pressure by the unit, the docket is now complete and the NPA could continue prosecuting the accused. “This case has now been dragging on for more than three years and AfriForum welcomes the fact that a date for the hearing has been set. We will continue monitoring the case and supporting the complainant to ensure that justice prevails,” says Adv. Phyllis Vorster, prosecutor at AfriForum’s Private Prosecution Unit.
