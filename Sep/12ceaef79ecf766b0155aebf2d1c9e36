ATM has asked the Public Protector to investigate Ramaphosa’s role in the irregular use of SANDF aircraft  13 September 2020 The African Transformation Movement (ATM) is neither shocked nor surprised at the insincere and grandstanding response by Ramaphosa to require the Minister of Defence to submit a report within 48hrs. It is our view that by acting ignorant or surprised, Ramaphosa is actually insulting the intelligence of the Nation and scape-goating using Minister Mapisa—Nqakula as a fall person particularly because he is on record announcing the Zimbabwe trip and its ANC NEC delegation. It is common that Ramaphosa was part of the ANC NEC meeting that deliberated on the need for the Zimbabwe trip and that he was aware of who the delegation would be. It is also common course that International trips for Ministers and their deputies are approved by the President. Ramaphosa also chairs the NCCC and he recently announced the current level two which means our international borders are closed for people except for goods. He therefore ought to have known that the delegation that had his blessings could not travel on commercial flights. As the Commander In Chief he also ought to have known that civilians like his ANC Comrades are not allowed to be in the SANDF Aircraft. Ramaphosa continues to widen the trust deficit between the Government and the people of South Africa by his repeated failure to be truthful and candid even on basic things. The citizens of South Africa deserve far better. The ATM has asked the Public Protector to investigate the apparent dereliction of duty by the Commander In Chief whose non-action and in fact complicity in the abuse of state resources (SANDF Aircraft) is a confirmation of our long-held view that he is unfit to be the Head of State.
