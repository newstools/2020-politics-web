Heritage Day: Preserving heritage ensures a nations’ survival 24 September 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));Heritage is a vital and inseparable part of any nation's survival. Destroying a nation's heritage in effect also destroys that nation. Preserving heritage ensures a nation's survival. It is, therefore, of the utmost importance for the Afrikaner nation to ensure that its heritage is protected and conserved for future generations to enable them to know who they are and where they come from. A nation can only be a proud nation if it is proud of its past and its heritage. South Africa's Constitution very clearly states that the country belongs to all who live in it, united in our diversity. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_3',113,'0','0']));Thus, the FF Plus encourages all South Africans to be proud of who and what they are – be proud to be coloured, be proud to be black and be proud to be white. Every nation must be afforded the opportunity to cherish, conserve and build out its own heritage. At present, this right of Afrikaners is being infringed upon and the ANC is busy driving a subtle process to destroy and demonise everything that has to do with the Afrikaner and their heritage. The so-called colonial and Afrikaner-history statues as well as the need to get rid of them seem to be on the agenda for the ruling party and EFF yet again. There is no doubt that it is a poorly disguised attempt to target the Afrikaner's heritage in general. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_4',114,'0','0']));The dismissal of other's heritage does not only apply to statues, but also to their language and cultural heritage as well. This kind of approach has no place in a country where the language and cultural heritage of communities are recognised and protected by its Constitution. It clearly is nothing but an attempt to strip the Afrikaner nations, and the younger generation in particular, of its pride and to make them feel ashamed of who and what they are. A comprehensive understanding of a nation, its heritage and history can prevent this from happening. The FF Plus is calling on every Afrikaner to proudly express their culture and to give recognition and have appreciation for the sacrifices that our forefathers made for our future.
