Lesufi’s attack on Afrikaans schools is based on absolute falsehoods 29 September 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));The Gauteng MEC for Education, Panyaza Lesufi, has targeted Afrikaans and single-medium schools and his umpteenth attack is based on the false premise that these schools deny other learners access to education. This is not true and is just cheap politicking by the MEC in an attempt to cover up his own incompetence. Only 6% of all public schools are still Afrikaans and, therefore, it is impossible that it could still have a negative or restrictive effect on other's access to education. These statistics were provided to the FF Plus by Lesufi himself in response to a written question on the matter. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));Lesufi also admitted that existing schools in poor communities are underperforming. He offered that as the reason why parents enrol their children at schools that perform better, but are situated further away from them. On top of that, it is a fact that new schools are not being built fast enough. The Gauteng Legislature's Portfolio Committee on Education has raised its concerns about the matter numerous times. Given these admissions, it is clear that the problem does not lie with Afrikaans or single-medium schools, but with Lesufi's own poor leadership.
