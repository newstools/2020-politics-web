Urgent e-Toll decision required 16 September 2020 News that SANRAL has issued a tender for the management of the controversial e-toll system in July, makes a decision on the future of e-tolls by cabinet an urgent one. The tender was adertised (and closes today) because cabinet has not yet informed SANRAL about which way it is going with e-tolls. The people of Gauteng have spoken and signalled to government in no uncertain terms that e-tolls must go. To waste time and energy in considering a tender that may never be awarded is counter productive. Even worse, if the tender is awarded and e-tolls is scrapped, it will leave a contractual burden for SANRAL. Government needs to make its decision on e-tolls known as a matter of urgency before the tender proceeds any further.
