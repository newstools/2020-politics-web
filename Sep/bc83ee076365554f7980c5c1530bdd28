In the world ranking of total number of cases per country, we have dropped from 5th position to 7th position. We are also encouraged to see the number of active cases steadily declining from 90 103 on 20 August 2020 to 62 582 today- this translates to a 31% decrease in 2 weeks. We continue to register a high recovery rate at 88%. The testing positivity rate continues to decline as well, now at 11% nationally- on the 12 of July, corresponding more or less with the peak of our pandemic, we recorded the highest positivity rate at 30%. Despite ranking 7th for the number of positive cases identified, we rank number 13 for the cumulative number of COVID-19 related deaths recorded. On 1 September, the Medical Research Council reported that unnatural deaths continue to decline (although this decline has slowed down). On the under hand, it would be remiss of me not to inform the public that the same report indicated that unnatural deaths have increased following the easing of alcohol restrictions- unnatural deaths now exceed the MRC predicted number. We have been very concerned to see videos on social media of people hosting large parties and going to shebeens, taverns and bars beyond the curfew. We urge our people to continue observing  health protocols such as social distancing, wearing of masks, sanitizing and washing of hands. We also caution against sharing of drinks, cigarettes, cigars, shisha pipes (“hubbly bubbly”) etc. Be aware that if you do this you have directly put yourself at risk. Whilst socializing and having fun, do not let your guard down and put your life and the lives of your loved ones at risk. The threat of a second wave remains very real. As we start the weekend, we wish to plead with South Africans to adhere to the curfew and not to drink excessively and irresponsibly.
