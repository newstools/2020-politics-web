South African Human Rights Commission’s equality court proceedings regarding Economic Freedom Fighter’s social media post 21 September 2020 The FW de Klerk Foundation welcomes the decision of the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) to institute proceedings against the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in the Equality Court arising from comments posted in the social media on 14 September 2019. The Twitter and Facebook posting by the EFF broadcast a video that included a number of quotes from the late President Robert Mugabe, stating that “the only white man you can trust is a dead white man” and “our party must continue to strike fear in the heart of the white man, our real enemy.” In the SAHRC’s opinion, these statements “constitute various violations of the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act …” The Foundation believes that all our constitutional institutions should, in an even-handed manner, guard against statements and actions from any quarter that might violate the law and undermine the core values of the Constitution.
