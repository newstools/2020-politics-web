DA calls for strengthening of rural safety patrols after brutal farm attack 29 September 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));The Democratic Alliance (DA) calls for the urgent strengthening of the South African Police Services (SAPS) rural safety patrols after another brutal farm attack in Bronkhorstspruit this week. The DA called for urgent action in the area earlier this year after four suspects attacked a Bronkhorstspruit couple and the seven orphans in their care, but SAPS remained unmoved. While SAPS patrol vehicles sit in the government garage for months communities are forced to do their own patrols. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_3',113,'0','0']));The DA recently introduced the Gauteng Community Safety Oversight Bill which will devolve increased powers to Neighbourhood Watches and Community Police Forums in rural communities that have been abandoned by the ANC-led Provincial Government. The Bill will also increase civilian oversight over community safety in Gauteng. Since the DA began the rural safety watching brief in Gauteng in June more than 90% of the 29 farm attacks and murders in that time period have not seen any arrests. Where there are arrests it is the security company or a family member tracking down the perpetrators. Despite farmers and rural communities facing a four times higher risk of attack than other citizens, the Minister of Police, Bheki Cele, has refused to classify farm attacks and murders as a priority crime and allocate the necessary resources to ensure that SAPS rural safety patrols are operational. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_4',114,'0','0']));It is now time for the President to also acknowledge the perpetual fear and danger that our rural communities live and work in.
