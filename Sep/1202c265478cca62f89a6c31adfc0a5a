This means that in some instances, cases could be allocated to the wrong sub-districts. We are working with the sub-districts to clean and verify the data and where errors are picked up locally, cases will be re-allocated to the correct areas. The Western Cape has recorded an additional 8 deaths, bringing the total number of COVID-19 related deaths in the province to 4182. We send our condolences to their families and friends at this time. Monitoring test positivity rates:eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_5',114,'0','0'])); We continue to record positive signs of recovery in the Western Cape. Our hospitalisation numbers have declined significantly and now sit at under 500. In most regions in the Western Cape, the test positivity rate currently stands at an average of below 10%. This is the percentage of all tests conducted which return a positive result and we have seen this steadily decrease over time. There are however a few sub-districts which are recording test positivity rates higher than the provincial average and which require that residents pay special attention to infection prevention measures to help slow the spread. These areas include Oudtshoorn, Knysna and areas in the Central Karoo, including Beaufort West, Laingsburg and Prince Albert. This is likely because different areas of the province have experienced different curves, and in the case of the Central Karoo, recorded their first infections much later than the metro. The actual number of infections in the Central Karoo remains low- with the three sub-districts of Beaufort West, Laingsburg and Prince Albert only registering a combined total of 914 positive cases to date and we must all work together to ensure that these numbers remain low. By taking steps to change our behaviour now, we can help ensure that the test positivity rate in all of these areas starts to drop in line with the provincial average. This week, my community liaison team, #TeamPremier are on the ground in Beaufort West where they are distributing masks, and sharing information with residents and businesses to remind them to observe the golden rules of infection prevention and encouraging them to safely support local businesses. Western Cape Health Minister, Nomafrench Mbombo was also in the Central Karoo region today, where she held community events to encourage behaviour change in Murraysburg and in Beaufort West. Wherever you are in the province, there are a few simple things which we can all do to ensure that we are continuing to slow the spread of COVID-19. These must become part of our everyday lives and routines and include: eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-banner-1','ezslot_4',116,'0','0']));-Wearing a mask whenever you are out in public. The mask must be worn correctly, covering your nose and mouth, and you must clean your hands before and after putting it on or taking it off. -Practicing social distancing by keeping a space of at least 1.5 metres between you and any other person when in public spaces like at the supermarket, in malls and taxi ranks, or while queuing at the bank, or while accessing government services like social grants, motor vehicle licenses, Home Affairs or SARS. -Keeping your hands clean by thoroughly washing or sanitising them regularly and ensuring that you keep high-traffic surfaces throughout your home or workspace clean. You should also avoid touching your face, and ensure that if you must cough or sneeze, that you do so into a tissue or into the crook of your arm.
