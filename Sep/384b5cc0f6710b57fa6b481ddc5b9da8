EFF CONDEMNS ABUSE OF STATE RESOURCES BY ANC-LEADERS Friday, 11 September 2020 The Economic Freedom Fighters condemns the abuse of state resources by the ANC. In an act reminiscent of the infamous Gupta Waterkloof landing, a delegation of civilians from the ANC used a military aircraft to conduct party business in Zimbabwe. They were aided by the Minister of Defense Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula in a gross abuse of state resources. This abuse of power reveals a ruling party that has no grasp of the separation of powers between the party and the state. It reveals an organization whose corruption has gone on with such impunity that they now use military aircrafts to conduct lift clubs. The ANC envoys to Zimbabwe have no right to utilize state resources to conduct their business and furthermore have no clearance to utilize military resources. It is a slippery slope when military apparatus is used by a political party to further its interests and relations with other political parties. As a country, we will reap the consequences of this abuse of military power the day the ANC is confronted with the loss of political power. The EFF calls for the suspension of the Defense Minister Mapise-Nqakula for abusing state resources to further a political party agenda. We further call for the ANC to compensate the state for the illegal use of its resources. Statement issued by the EFF, 11 September 2020
