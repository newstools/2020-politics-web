Denel’s contempt of court case postponed 3 December 2020 The court case dealing with Denel’s contempt of court was postponed to 27 January 2021. Solidarity has brought this case on behalf of its members whose arrear salaries have still not been paid by Denel. In terms of a court order given on 4 August, Denel was supposed to have paid all arrear salaries, including statutory obligations, by 7 August. Due to its failure to do so Solidarity has brought a case of contempt of court against Denel. The court today ruled that Denel’s board must be given an opportunity to respond to Solidarity’s affidavit. “We are disappointed but respect the judge’s ruling,” HelgardCronjé, sector coordinator for aviation and defence at Solidarity said. “We still maintain that it should be Denel’s first priority to give effect to the 4 August court order. As Denel has not done so, we took them to court for contempt of court. We will be back in court on 27 January to keep on fighting for our members and for what is their due. We feel for our members, the innocent workers at Denel, who are still receiving less than half of their salaries and who are the real victims of this state of affairs,” Cronjé concluded.
