NSFAS must clarify when extended student allowances will be paid  11 December 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) calls on the Minister of Higher Education, Blade Nzimande, and the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) to give clear direction on when the Scheme will extend allowances to those students who will continue their current academic year into 2021. This week, students at the Nelson Mandela University and Rhodes University expressed their concern as many are still waiting for their NSFAS allowances to be paid out. This, despite the Minister giving assurances that additional living allowances to cover meals and personal expenses would be made available to students whose academic year has been extended. The Minister has confirmed that a total of 16 higher education institution will extend their academic year to 2021: North-West University, Rhodes University, and the University of Mpumalanga will complete their academic year in January 2021; Central University of Technology, Durban University of Technology, Mangosuthu University of Technology, Nelson Mandela University, University of KwaZulu-Natal, University of Limpopo, University of Venda, University of Zululand and Vaal University of Technology in February 2021; and Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University, Tshwane University of Technology, University of Fort Hare, and Walter Sisulu University in March 2021. The higher education sector has experienced stringent budgetary conditions, in part, due to the Covid-19 pandemic as well as the immoral R10.5 billion bailout to the ANC’s bankrupt SAA vanity project. The DA, therefore, welcomes the decision to extend NSFAS allowances in light of these circumstances. However, the announcement must be followed with adequate implementation. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_2',115,'0','0']));NSFAS must urgently give clear indication to universities on when these funds will be disbursed to students and over which time period. No student should be left behind due to unforeseen circumstances beyond their control. Issued by Chantel King, DA Shadow Minister for Higher Education, Science & Technology, 11 December 2020
