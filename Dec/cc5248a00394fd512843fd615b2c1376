DA welcomes long-overdue hearing into Judge Hlophe misconduct allegations 8 December 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomes the eventual commencement of the hearing into allegations of judicial misconduct levelled against the Western Cape Judge President, John Hlophe, albeit after 12 years of unnecessary and avoidable delays. We hope that this hearing will send a strong message that nobody is above the law. This saga began in 2008 when a complaint was laid with the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) against Hlophe for allegedly trying to influence the outcome of cases related to corruption charges against former President Jacob Zuma, who was the President of the ANC at the time. Hlophe also faces allegations of assault, abusive language and abuse of power. The DA reiterates our call for Judge Hlophe to be suspended pending the outcome of the hearing into this matter. We are firmly of the view that there should be no impediment to ensuring that the matter is conducted in a swift uncompromised manner that restores the credibility, and independence of the Judiciary, and increases the public confidence in the courts. It would also allow for the process of restoring faith in the Western Cape Bench to commence. It should not have taken 12 years to bring Judge Hlophe to justice. It is disheartening that anyone with serious allegations of misconduct against them has been allowed to continue to sit at the helm of the Western Cape Division of the High Court. The continuous delays in this matter not only damaged the image and the integrity of our Courts but has also brought its independence into question. The DA has consistently held the view that where sufficient prima facie evidence exists to warrant an investigation into serious matters involving the Judiciary, such allegations must be swiftly investigated to restore the decorum and integrity of our courts.
