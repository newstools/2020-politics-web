Matric Exam leak: DA calls for probe to be finalised urgently to prevent rewrites 5 December 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[468,60],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));The Democratic Alliance (DA) calls on the Department of Basic Education and law enforcement agencies to urgently finalise the investigation into the Matric Exam leak in order to mitigate the possibility of all Matriculants having to rewrite their Mathematics and Physics exam papers. Hopefully, if these leaks are found and the extent of the leaks are identified, thousands of Matriculants could be spared having to rewrite these question papers. It is unacceptable that all Matriculants may have to suffer the consequences of the poor decisions made by a few. Every possible action has to be taken to ensure that not all Matriculants have to rewrite the exams. It simply isn’t acceptable to keep the learners and families in this state of flux. The entire first term of 2021 is now in jeopardy. Certainly 2020 has been enough for Matriculants. Everything must be done to help the class of 2020. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));The DA reiterates our call for investigations into these leaks to be completed promptly to ensure that all those implicated and found guilty are held to account.
