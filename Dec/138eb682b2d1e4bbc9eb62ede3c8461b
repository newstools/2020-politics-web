SAPO gives in to sustained pressure: pays medical contributions  7 December 2020 Solidarity is pleased to announce that the South African Post Office(SAPO) has paid its first instalment to MEDiPOS, the medical fund for post office employees. This comes after Solidarity threatened to take legal action against the institution to force it to meet its statutory obligations that have become overdue. “This is a major win for our members although it only brings temporary relief. Employees now have the assurance that, for the foreseeable future, they will still be members of MEDiPOS and their medical cover will not be suspended by 1 January,” Anton van der Bijl, head of Labour Law Services at Solidarity said. “However, we are not going to let the matter rest there as we are looking for a permanent solution where payments will be made regularly according to service contracts”. Solidarity makes the point that it would not hesitate to pursue further litigation against SAPO until all overdue funds have been paid and employees have the permanent reassurance that they would have access to their medical aid benefits. “Solidarity will keep on fighting for the interests of its members and will continue to put pressure on SAPO to find a solution and to ensure that SAPO does not again fail to meet its contractual obligations towards its employees,” Van der Bijl concluded.
