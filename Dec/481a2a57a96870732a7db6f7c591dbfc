Matric rewrite: DA calls for report to be published 8 December 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));The Democratic Alliance (DA) calls on the Minister of Basic Education, Angie Motshekga, to publicise the preliminary report of the National Investigation Task Team on the leaked Matric examination papers. It is unfathomable how a Minister of Basic Education can jump to the conclusion that the leaked papers are too widespread before an official report on the investigation has determined this as evidence. It is further worrying that a leak of this kind warrants a total rewrite into not one, but two papers – a first in South African history. The DA therefore demands Motshekga publish the report so that the investigation can be scrutinized for its thoroughness. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));A detailed investigation from the Task Team would identify to what extent the leaked papers were spread. Hopefully this will see thousands of innocent Matriculants across the country not having to rewrite their Mathematics and Physics exam papers during a year – one of the most important in their lives – which has already been disrupted. It is unacceptable that all Matricshave to suffer the consequences of the poor decisions made by a few. The Minister of Basic Education should be the guardian of the security and credibility of the exams, be it through her own department or its contractors. Simultaneously, as guardian, she has to ensure every possible action must be taken to ensure the class of 2020 does not suffer further.
