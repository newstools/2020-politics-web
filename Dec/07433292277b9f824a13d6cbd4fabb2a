Legal action against state refusing to place doctor after studies 10 December 2020 Solidarity today launched its urgent legal process on behalf of Dr. Bianca Lucas against the Department of Health. This follows the department’s failure to place the young doctor, after completion of her studies, at any medical centre or hospital.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0'])); "It is outrageous that the state will oblige young doctors to go through a process which then is delayed by the state due to their own incompetence. Doctors are expected to complete additional internships and community years after years of study. Yet, one cannot even rely on the government to manage the basic placement within this system,” says Anton van der Bijl, head of legal matters at Solidarity. Solidarity today sent a letter of demand to the Department of Health in which they order the placement of Dr. Lucas. The department has been threatened with further legal action that will radically review the overall system. "It is time for the state to admit that it cannot rise to the administrative challenge it has set for itself. It must relinquish its control and decentralise the system so that the private sector can step in to facilitate internships. In this way, young doctors will have the opportunity to complete their community years and enter the labour market that is experiencing a shortage. We will continue to pursue our case to force the department to meet its obligations to Dr. Lucas,” concludes van der Bijl.eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_3',113,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_4',113,'0','1'])); Read the letter of demand here.
