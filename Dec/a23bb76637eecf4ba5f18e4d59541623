And a pointer to the future for wider constructive input from its alumni in the affairs of the University. This is how Prof Wim de Villiers, Rector and Vice-Chancellor of SU, sums up the outcome of the recent Convocation election, where a total of 9 877 votes were cast for the three vacant positions in the Executive Committee. A total of 3 380 votes were recorded for the vacancy of President of Convocation, 3 397 for the position of Secretary and 3 100 for the vacancy of an additional ordinary member. “This is part of the University's remarkable successes during this pandemic year with its many challenges. Not only was the electronic voting process and the virtual annual meeting a 'first' for Convocation, but it facilitated a wider involvement of alumni that exponentially reduced the limitations of a physical gathering and at the same time opened new avenues for the advisory role and task of Convocation, "says Prof De Villiers. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_4',113,'0','0']));The purpose of Convocation, as set out in the Statute of Stellenbosch University, is to promote the welfare of the University through a mutually beneficial relationship between the institution and the members of Convocation, and to, where appropriate, advise Senate and Council.
