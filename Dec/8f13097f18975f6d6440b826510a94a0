Appointment of Former Joburg Mayor Parks Tau as Economic Development MEC concerning 2 December 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng notes the latest reshuffle of Premier David Makhura’s executive after the position of MEC of Health was left vacant, when the Premier fired Bandile Masuku, the MEC for Health. However, it is concerning to note that the Premier has appointed the Former Joburg Mayor, Parks Tau as the new MEC for Economic Development. Tau who is yet to be sworn in as a member of the Gauteng Provincial Legislature has been implicated in alleged corruption involving Regiments Capital. In 2012 media reports emerged indicating that there may have been a conflict of interest when Tau’s wife, Philisiwe Twala-Tau received a stake in a Capitec Bank black economic empowerment deal in 2006 worth around R10 million, led by Regiments Capital. At the time, Tau was the MMC responsible for treasury. It is concerning to note that Tau has been appointed to the executive, given that Premier Makhura had removed the former MEC for Health from that position because of his involvement in a controversial PPE tender that was awarded by the Department of Health. The DA will be keeping a close eye on the new MEC for Economic Development to ensure that there this department is run in a transparent manner. The current MEC for Social Development, NomathembaMokgethi has been appointed as the new MEC for Health. The new MEC for Health needs to hit the ground running to confront the ongoing Covid-19 crisis and fix the deep-rooted rot in the Gauteng Health Department.
