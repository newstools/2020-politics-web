Presidency dismisses report in The Star as complete fabrication 14 December 2020 - 4:00pm The Presidency dismisses as a complete fabrication a report that appeared in The Star today, 14 December 2020, titled, ‘CR plotting PP’s arrest’. The report makes claims about President Cyril Ramaphosa and Presidency staff that are simply false and for which the newspaper provides no evidence. President Ramaphosa has no knowledge of, nor any involvement in, the matters to which the article refers. The Star makes very serious claims about the President’s conduct without any factual basis. It is irresponsible and reckless journalism that deserves to be dismissed out of hand. The President is firmly committed to the rule of law and due process. He has never and will never interfere in any criminal investigation or other legal process. Statement issued by Tyrone Seale, Acting Spokesperson to the President, 14 December 2020
