DA to lay ethics complaint against Cele over Camps Bay film shoot fiasco 17 December 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) will lay a complaint with Parliament’s Ethics Committee against the Minister of Police, Bheki Cele, after he appeared to issue unlawful operational instructions to South African Police Service (SAPS) officials to shut down a film shoot at Camps Bay beach on Wednesday. Minister Cele reportedly instructed 16 police officers to shut down the shoot, despite the filming crew being in possession of a legal permit from the City of Cape Town. We believe that these instructions by Cele was an overreach of his powers as Police Minister and that he is not legally authorised to issue operational instructions to members of the SAPS. In what seems to be a clear attempt by the Minister to grandstand in front of the cameras, he completely disregarded his Ministerial mandate and the extent of his authority. Cele appears to be confused as to whether he is the Minister of Police or the National Police Commissioner. This is exactly what happens when politicians are unduly referred to as “General”. The people of South Africa are tired of Cele’s cavalier cowboy antics and the DA will fight to ensure he is brought to book. Issued by Andrew Whitfield, DA Shadow Minister of Police, 17 December 2020
