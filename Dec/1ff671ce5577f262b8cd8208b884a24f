South Africans have demonstrated that they place their confidence in large parties like the DA with a proven track record of governance, instead of smaller parties. In yesterday's elections, the DA retained 6 out of 8 DA Wards receiving an average vote of 68% in the wards that we held. We obtained thumping majorities in the City of Cape Town (Ward 115) at 82.30% and eThekwini (Ward 66) at 85.03% of votes cast. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));Importantly, the DA resonates with black voters and is making significant in-roads into ANC strongholds. The DA growth in black voting districts was up 135% on 2019. In the Western Cape, in Ward 115 in the City of Cape Town, DA support grew showing a 12.68 percentage point increase. As predicted, smaller party GOOD, has not managed to break the 5% ceiling. The reality is that this party cannot and will not bring real hope or real change in this local government context. The DA also retained Langeberg. Over the past year, the DA embarked on a journey to correct its path. Organizations must go through a period of renewal and regrowth. This inevitably led to some disgruntled councillors, most of them facing disciplinary action, leaving the party. This is what happened in Oudtshoorn, where we have lost 2 Wards. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_4',114,'0','0']));The DA is the only major party that is prepared to take firm action to ensure good governance is in place, even if doing so may generate temporary setbacks. We learnt lessons from the review panel report and listened to our voters and will continue to do so. It is significant to note that in Ward 4, Oudtshoorn, with a majority black electorate, DA support held while the ANC support continued its downward course going from 47.04% to 42.25%. of the vote. Similarly, in Limpopo, in Ward 1 in Musina, where the demographic is majority black, DA support jumped from 13.80% in 2019 to 22.07%. These figures are proof that the DA remains the strong, rational centre where those from all races may feel heard and are genuinely represented. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_1',115,'0','0']));We are furthermore delighted with our results in Gauteng, in Ekurhuleni (Wards 27, 28) where we have held stable. The independent candidates endorsed by Herman Mashaba's ActionSA made no impact on our electoral support. These by-election results bare testament to the decisive and unifying new DA leadership under John Steenhuisen, the regrowth of the only party big enough to beat the ANC. The DA is the only party in South Africa that is prepared to hold its own accountable against our values of clean governance. We will continue to do so. South Africans deserve nothing less.
