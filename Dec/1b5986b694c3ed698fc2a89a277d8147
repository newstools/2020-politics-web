This means that in some instances, cases could be allocated to the wrong sub-districts. We are working with the sub-districts to clean and verify the data and where errors are picked up locally, cases will be re-allocated to the correct areas. The Western Cape has recorded additional 34 deaths, bringing the total number of COVID-19 related deaths in the province to 4799 .We send our condolences to their loved ones at this time. Increased enforcement activities underway: The Western Cape Government this week detailed its three pronged approach to managing the Covid-19 resurgence in the province. The three prongs include a continuation of our healthcare response to ensure that those who need care are able to access it, behavioural change and increased enforcement. In line with our commitment to a whole of government approach to flattening the resurgence of infections in the province, we have been working with traffic, law enforcement, environmental health officers and SAPS on increased enforcement of safety protocols and the alert level 1 regulations. As part of these operations, overseen by our Disaster Management teams, roadblocks have been held at key entry and exit points to the province, including the N2 at Grabouw and also outside of Beaufort West. On the Garden Route, roadblocks are planned for key routes around Mossel Bay, and compliance checks are also being conducted at businesses, pubs and taverns. In Knysna inspections are also being conducted at businesses and public ammenities. Last night, City of Cape Town Law enforcement officials conducted inspections at businesses along Bree and Long Streets where warning notices were issued for non-compliance. Follow up visits will be conducted over the course of the weekend and those still found to be non-compliant will be fined. Health awareness activities are also planned at sites around the province including in the Mossel Bay CBD, the KwaNonquba Asla Park and Great Brak River areas on an ongoing, daily basis. eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-banner-1','ezslot_1',116,'0','0']));Health promoters will also be visiting certain shopping centres and public spaces throughout the Cape Winelands district this weekend. The behaviour change aspect of our response rests in all of our hands. I call on businesses to evaluate their safety protocols to reduce the risk of infections occurring there. This includes ensuring that premises and venues are well ventilated, crowds are limited and hygiene protocols are in place. Residents must ensure that they are complying with the rules and taking measures to protect themselves and others. If we all work hard to rollback the resurgence now, we can flatten the curve and ensure that businesses can continue to operate, that our healthcare system will be able to provide care to all of those who need it, and that we can protect our most vulnerable including the elderly, and those at higher risk as a result of diabetes, hypertension, heart and lung illnesses and other comorbidities.
