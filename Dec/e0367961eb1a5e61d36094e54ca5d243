If the ANC is serious about corruption Magashule and others should step aside 15 December 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));The DA notes reports which indicate that the ANC Integrity Commission has recommended that Ace Magashule steps aside as Secretary General of the ANC pending the outcome his corruption charges. The DA has long held that the ANC is unable to act against their own corrupt leaders because the rot runs deep. It’s not enough to simply leave leaders like Magashule in key and influential positions while they await for the court processes to run its course. He, in particular yields significant power within the ANC and by extension across its governments. Left in this position, further looting of public money and resources could continue while we wait for the ANC as they drag their feet. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_9',113,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_10',113,'0','1']));The reality is that if the governing party is serious about corruption then Magashule and every other implicated leader - in government and within their ranks - must be removed until a court has adjudicated on their issues. The DA has no interest in the ANC’s internal processes which have yielded no results in fighting corruption and jailing those who have pillaged the national coffers over decades. However, the ANC and its leader, President Cyril Ramaphosa cannot keep paying lip service to fighting corruption when many of the people who sit on the organization’s decision making structures - government positions and parliamentary benches - are suspected or accused of corruption. If the ANC is serious about cleaning house, they should start with Magashule and work their way through the organization even if they all end up in jail. This is what is expected from a governing party by the people of South Africa.
