 Over the festive season we are offering our readers an opportunity - on special offer - to upgrade to full Politicsweb membership. This is for a limited time and for a limited number of places only. If you sign up you will gain unrestricted access to our content, the reader optimised version of our site (no in-text advertisements), and the exclusive member's only material we will be rolling out in 2021. You will also help support our existing work, defend our independence, and allow us to provide you with ever-better content. The cost is an up-front payment of $39,96 (R600 at the current exchange rate) for 12 months of membership. This works out to R50 per month over the year. We are making 199 memberships available on this offer, and it will expire on the 1st of January 2021.
