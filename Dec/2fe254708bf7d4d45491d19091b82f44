Candidacy: SU Convocation 2 December 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));Stellenbosch University has received a complaint against the candidacy of three nominees for the filling of vacant positions in the executive committee of the SU Convocation. Dr Leon Schreiber, LP and DA member for Stellenbosch, insists that the participation of the three candidates in the current Convocation elections be declared invalid on the grounds that their vision statements on the nomination forms exceeded the permitted 50 words by between 3 to 14 words. According to Dr Schreiber they have not complied with the nomination requirements and enjoy an unfair advantage in relation to the other candidates. “SU does not concur with the view of Dr Schreiber that the three candidates be disqualified. The election is currently under way and will continue as planned. Members of the Convocation can still vote until midnight on Wednesday 7 December 2020,“says Dr Ronel Retief, SU Registrar.
