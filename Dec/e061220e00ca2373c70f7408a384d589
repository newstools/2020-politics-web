A criteria was formulated by our scientists and modeling teams. As it stands as a country we now meet that criteria. It is also important to highlight that four provinces, that being, Western Cape, Eastern Cape, KwaZulu Natal and Gauteng Province are the key drivers of this new wave. To break it down: The majority of new cases today are from WC (30%) followed by EC (24%) then KZN which accounted for 23%; and GP accounted for 17%. The Free State, Limpopo, Mpumalanga and North West each accounted for 1% of new cases respectively while Northern Cape accounted for less than 1% It is important as well to highlight that today we have breached 6 000 in terms of new cases and the total new cases today identified is 6 709 thus giving us a total of 828 598 cumulative cases today.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_4',113,'0','0'])); Province Total cases for 09 December 2020 Percentage total Eastern Cape 140647 17,0 Free State 59501 7,2 Gauteng 240261 29,0 KwaZulu-Natal 134184 16,2 Limpopo 18940 2,3 Mpumalanga 31906 3,9 North West 35223 4,3 Northern Cape 23517 2,8 Western Cape 144419 17,4 Unknown 0 0,0 Total 828598 100,0 There are some seriously concerning issues I need to bring to the attention of the public: We would like to indicate that, having observed the trends in the past couple of weeks, we had already sent a letter to all MEC’s urging them to prepare their respective provinces for a second wave. The key issues that we have raised are that the provinces need to ensure that testing turnaround times are as quick as possible to facilitate patient flow, assess bed capacity including recalling field hospital beds, attend to staffing and equipment needs urgently and to tighten up monitoring and evaluation and reporting to national department. Testing Data A cumulative 5 690 263 tests have been completed, of which 38 200 have been conducted since the last report.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_5',114,'0','0']));  Previously we had indicated that the NICD had migrated to a new system for capturing tests which now also capture the antigen tests.
