There is simply no basis for the motion and is quite frivolous, It is indeed a testimony to the strength of our democracy that a two-MP-party in our proportional representation system can get their voice heard, It is a pity, however, that they chose to squander this opportunity in this manner, We are confident that the ANC MPs who will debate the motion, will represent us well, We note that they are now considering to postpone their motion until next year and that they intend approaching the court for a secret ballot. They are displaying their fear of their irrelevance. Whatever the court decides, the ANC stands ready to defeat the motion Our confidence ands the confidence of the people in the leadership of President Cyril Ramaphosa remain unwavering, Accordingly, we urge ATM, to focus its attention on inputs that would strengthen the Economic Transformation and Recovery Plan led by the President, so that together we can set the country's economy on an irreversible upward trajectory.
