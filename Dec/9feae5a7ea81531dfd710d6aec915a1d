DA condemns ANC MKMVA’s threat directed at the Zondo Commission 2 December 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));The Democratic Alliance (DA) finds utterances by the ANC MKMVA President, KebbyMaphatsoe, referring to the likelihood of a coup d'état or civil unrest if former President Jacob Zuma is charged regrettable and gravely concerning. In a reaction to the criminal complaint laid against Zuma by the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into State Capture for his antics last week, the ANC MKMVA issued a warning to the Commission to tread lightly and warned that those who love Zuma might react with “emotions” and that this might result in President Cyril Ramaphosa being overthrown. The DA condemns these utterances with the strongest contempt, as we will not allow the legitimacy of the Commission in uncovering the rot of corruption in the State to be undermined by groupings with shallow populist agendas. The MKMVA, just like the EFF, is an organisation that display contemptuous attitudes towards constitutionalism. These organisations thrive on violence and have absolutely no regard for the Constitution or the rule of law. This flies against the principles of our democracy. The DA calls on the Deputy Chief Justice, Raymond Zondo, to publicly condemn the MKMVA’s attempt to undermine the work of the Commission which is protected by the country’s Constitution. We cannot allow these disparaging waves of attacks and acts of intimidation against the Zondo Commission by pseudo revolutionaries to weaken and derail our resolve to fight against corruption and looting that has weakened State institutions.
