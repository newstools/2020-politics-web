This means that in some instances, cases could be allocated to the wrong sub-districts. We are working with the sub-districts to clean and verify the data and where errors are picked up locally, cases will be re-allocated to the correct areas. The Western Cape has recorded an additional 5 deaths, bringing the total number of COVID-19 related deaths in the province to 4208. We send our condolences to their families and friends at this time. Campaign to support Grade 12s to finish their matric year: The Western Cape Department of Education, under the leadership of Minister Debbie Schafer, has launched a new campaign aimed at encouraging the Class of 2020 to finish their matric year. The #CommitToFinish campaign is aimed at encouraging, motivating and supporting Grade 12 learners up until the final NSC examinations. The Class of 2020 has faced many challenges and disruptions throughout this school year and despite this, we have seen learners and teachers alike show real courage and commitment to learning- from self-study, to home schooling and learning through various social media platforms. I have no doubt that the Class of 2020 is tough, driven, innovative and resilient, and we want to see them use these attributes to really shine in their final exams. My message to matrics today is this: You have come so far and the finish line is within your reach. Pushing through now will all be worth it in the end.  As the campaign message states- You will thank yourself later. The new campaign imagines a Future You or an older version of the matriculant, thanking them for making the choice to finish. Using the AE Face Tool,  three Grade 12 learners from Parel Vallei High School were filmed and their faces transformed into an older-looking version of themselves. This allowed their future selves to thank their younger selves for making the choice to finish their matric year. Matric learners can pledge their commitment to finish on a dedicated website (www.CommitToFinish.co.za) where they will also be able to access NSC exam information, matric support resources as well as the E-portal. The campaign is running on social media platforms, on billboards and is being shared directly to matrics via SMS and in emails to schools. Each learner will also receive an exam support booklet encouraging them to #CommitToFinish. This booklet also provides exam advice, bursary options and past papers for eight high-enrolment subjects. (English Home Language, Afrikaans First Additional Language, Accounting, Business Studies, Geography, History, Life Sciences, Mathematics, Mathematical Literacy and Physical Sciences.) eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-banner-1','ezslot_5',116,'0','0']));With less than a month to go until the exams, I would like to wish our matric class well and call on parents, friends and communities who know someone currently in matric, to offer them the support and encouragement they need to finish their school career strong. World Teacher's Day: Today, I would like to send a special message to each and every teacher in this province to say thank you for the work that you do and to acknowledge the lives that you have helped change. Throughout the pandemic, we have heard remarkable stories of teachers doing amazing things to help their pupils continue learning. Since the beginning of the lockdown, we have seen teachers present lessons via social media and radio. Others have worked hard to ensure that learners receive learning materials at home, while others have become active in helping feed their communities. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-large-leaderboard-2','ezslot_4',117,'0','0']));On behalf of the Western Cape, I would like to express my gratitude for all that you do in ensuring that our children and our young people are learning the knowledge and skills that will set them up for success in the future.
