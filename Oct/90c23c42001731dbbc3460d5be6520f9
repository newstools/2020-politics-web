Mkhwebane shows her last Ace in the Poker game she has played with South Africa  1 October 2020eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0'])); The Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane, has again proven that she is not fit for office and that she is in fact politically compromised. Mkhwebane on Wednesday released a report in which she once again exonerates ANC secretary-general, Ace Magashule, this time for failing to reply honestly and adequately to questions posed by the DA in the Free State Provincial Legislature during his time as Premier. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_3',113,'0','0']));Previously, she published a whitewashed report into the Vrede Dairy Project which failed to make any findings against Magashule and Mosebenzi Zwane. While the Public Protector swears high and low that she is not politically compromised her continuously turning a blind eye to the transgressions and wrongdoing of Ace Magashule is telling. If Mkhwebane is truly independent as she claims, she would freely subject herself to any process which seek to hold her to account. But instead, she chooses to discredit these legitimate processes. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_4',114,'0','0']));Recently, Mkhwebane launched an urgent application with the Western Cape Division of the High Court in order to interdict Parliament’s inquiry into her fitness to hold office. The DA views this application by the Public Protector as frivolous and a complete waste of taxpayer money. She is attempting to frustrate a legitimate and legally sound parliamentary process to hold her to account in order to seemingly continue to do the bidding of Ace Magashule and his fellow rogues.
