AfriForum continues fight against expropriation without compensation 20 October 2020 The civil rights organisation AfriForum will attend the public hearings on expropriation without compensation to be heard in Limpopo and the Northern and Western Cape over the next two weeks. The hearings in the other provinces, which the organisation also attended, were finalised earlier in the year. It is evident that the government has not parted with its plans to amend the Constitution to allow for expropriation without compensation. AfriForum is therefore continuing its fight against this destructive policy. “Government’s ongoing pursuit of expropriation without compensation is incredibly reckless – and this despite serious warnings from economists, major international voices and civil society. In light of the serious damage that government’s lockdown regulations inflicted on the economy, it is now more important than ever to provide international and local investors with certainty regarding property rights. The protection of property rights is an important building block for economic recovery – and only a government that is totally and blindly-ideological in driving this policy would disregard this fact,” says Ernst Roets, AfriForum’s Head of Policy and Action.
