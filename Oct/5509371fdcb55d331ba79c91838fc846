DA condemns ANC's use of City resources for electioneering 19 October 2020 Note to Editors: Pictures of ANC councillors using the resources of the City of Johannesburg for electioneering can be seen here, here, here and here. The Democratic Alliance (DA) condemns the ANC’s use of City resources for electioneering purposes as a complete abuse of power and a clear indication that it will stop at nothing to achieve its own ends. In a recent Facebook post, a City official, Sipho Zak Masigo, proudly displayed pictures of ANC councillors in party regalia making telephone calls from the City of Johannesburg offices under the hashtags #VictoryIsCertain and #ByElections. Shockingly, among those appearing in the pictures is a senior member of council Tshidi Mfikoe, who serves as the chairperson of the infrastructure committee and should know better and be setting a more ethical example. It is highly unacceptable that council resources that are meant to serve the residents of Johannesburg are being used to call upon ANC members to go out and vote for them. This is even more reason why the residents of Johannesburg should go out in their numbers on 11 November to vote for the DA to bring an end to this corruption and abuse of City resources. Five wards including 68, 120, 9, 41, and 130 will be contested during the upcoming by-elections in the City of Johannesburg on 11 November 2020.
