We have taken note of a persistent campaign by people calling themselves MK Veterans, led by Kebby Maphatsoe and Carl Niehaus. It is rather unfortunate that these individuals hide behind ANC structures to camouflage their nefarious intentions to loot state entities. Their ill-conceived actions are a retaliation informed by the actions we have taken in cleaning the rot at PRASA, with particular reference to the termination of security contracts that have achieved the opposite of what they were meant to deliver. The Auditor-General confirmed that these were irregular contracts and we had to take decisive steps not only to regularize these, but to bring in a security arrangement that protected the public assets. We are making strides in implementing decisive interventions to get PRASA on track, focused on delivering its public mandate. We will not be detracted in this important task by side shows orchestrated by individuals with malicious intentions. This is a campaign led by people who are determined to use the good name of MK. We are aware that this matter has nothing to do with MK as no legitimate ANC structure will condone a march and heaping of insults against an ANC Minister. We will not be cowed by the nefarious agendas that seek to loot state resources and cripple public institutions for narrow self-serving interests. South Africans must equally not be hoodwinked into believing lies that seek to advance personal interests at the expense of our service delivery mandate. We remain focused on our efforts to rebuild PRASA into an entity that will deliver a commuter rail service that is a backbone of our public transport system.
