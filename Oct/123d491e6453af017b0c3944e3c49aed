Freedom Under Law welcomes recommendation to suspend Judges Makhubele and Parker 15 October 2020 Freedom Under Law welcomes the decision of the Judicial Service Commission to recommend to the President that he suspend Judges Makhubele and Parker pending the conclusion of disciplinary proceedings against them. This is in sharp contrast to what has happened in the case of Judge John Hlophe, who has been allowed to continue as Judge President of the Western Cape High Court for over twelve years with a most serious charge hanging over his head. By acting firmly, fairly and speedily in cases of alleged gross misconduct by judges, the JSC does what the Constitution demands: ensure the integrity of the judiciary. This enhances confidence in our judiciary and at the same time increases confidence in the JSC itself. We accordingly look forward to a speedy and appropriate end to the proceedings against Judge Hlophe. Issued by Johann Kriegler, Chair, Freedom Under Law, 15 October 2020
