Response to Independent Media articles, Eskom releases the full Wim Trengove Report 5 October 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));Eskom would like to warn the public about the disinformation contained in some articles recently published in titles associated with the Independent Newspapers Group. The most recent alleges that Eskom Group Chief Executive Officer, André de Ruyter, was found by Advocate Wim Trengove to have misled the Eskom board in the matter of the fuel oil supply tender. Nothing could be further from the truth. For a while some journalists at Independent Newspapers have been avoiding giving Eskom sufficient notice to answer their questions, and then conveniently avoid the written answers in their stories. This leads us to conclude they have no intention of informing the public with the truth, but rather to pursue an agenda against the current leadership of Eskom. The Wim Trengove Report eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_3',113,'0','0']));It must be recorded forthwith that Advocate Wim Trengrove, in his investigation report dated 14 July 2020, unconditionally cleared the Eskom Group Chief Executive Officer, André de Ruyter, of accusations of misleading the board in the matter of tender COPR 4786. At its meeting on 20th July 2020 the Eskom Board adopted Advocate Trengrove’s report and expressed its full support for Mr De Ruyter. A copy of the report was sent to the shareholder, and has subsequently been circulated in the media. In order to end the speculation, Eskom today releases the full report, as attached.
