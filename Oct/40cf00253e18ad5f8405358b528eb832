Eskomâ€™s CFO, Mr Calib Cassim, is in agreement that this is a matter of significant importance to the country. It would be beneficial for a Superior Court to provide an order on the recovery of the misappropriated equity. Eskom is committed to a speedy outcome to this process as any further delay in resolving this matter continues to burden the economy of the country. It is hoped that this process will allow for adherence to the relevant legislative and regulatory requirements in the future.
