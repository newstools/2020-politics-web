VINCENT SMITH RELEASED ON R30K BAIL AND ANGELO AGRIZZI DID NOT APPEAR FOR MEDICAL REASONS Former parliamentarian and politician Vincent Smith was arrested this morning at the Merton Police station and shortly thereafter appeared in the Palm Ridge Magistrates Court on charges of corruption and fraud. He was granted bail of R30 000 (thirty thousand rand). He is expected back in court on the 14 October. eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));He is charged in his personal capacity as well as in his capacity as sole director and shareholder of Euroblitz (Pty) Ltd, alongside Angelo Agrizzi, former BOSASA Chief Operations Officer, who did not appear in court for medical reasons. Smith stands accused of accepting gratifications in the form of security upgrades to his home and cash transferred into his personal bank account via the bank account of his company, Euroblitz, in exchange for the use of his political influence as a member of Parliament for the ruling party, to shield BOSASA from accountability for corrupting officials in the Department of Correctional Services who awarded BOSASA contracts worth billions of rands. The three accused have been charged with contravening section 7 of the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act 12 of 2004 (PRECCA) and Smith alone was charged with fraud. Smith's fraud charge emanates from his failure to disclose to the Registrar of parliamentary members' interests the gratifications that he received from BOSASA, pursuant to the corrupt activities with which he, Euroblitz and Agrizzi are charged. Charges emanating from a related investigation into the tax affairs of Smith and Euroblitz will be enrolled separately. The Investigating Directorate worked closely with its partners in the South African Revenue Services (SARS) and the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigations (the Hawks) in bringing the accused before court.
