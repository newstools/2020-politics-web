Charges of terrorism and attempted murder against farmer after Senekal court case are unfair and smell of racism 9 October 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));The charges of, among other things, terrorism, attempted murder, incitement to violence and public violence brought against Mr André Pienaar (51) after the Senekal court case serve as proof that there are double standards when it comes to farmers and the agricultural community. The state today appointed a senior lawyer to oppose Mr Pienaar's bail application. It is clear that the prosecuting authority wants to make an example of Mr Pienaar and in so doing send a message to farmers and the agricultural community. The charges of terrorism and attempted murder are serious and unreasonable, so the prosecuting authority is guilty of being biased and, thus, it is not fulfilling its role as an objective authority that must act fairly and in the best interest of every person in the country. The prosecuting authority is supposed to always remain objective, equitable and fair toward all accused individuals. Clearly this is not the case here and the charges are being blown out of proportion. There was no sign of terrorism during the Senekal court case and nobody's life was endangered. These kinds of charges will only stir up emotions and could lead to even more conflict in South Africa. It comes down to further incitement by the prosecuting authority itself. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));No charges of terrorism or attempted murder were brought against members of the EFF when they went on a countrywide violent rampage of plundering Clicks stores. In addition, one did not see that such charges were brought against individuals after countrywide service delivery protests during which police vehicles were torched and private properly was destroyed. It is totally unacceptable and as leader of the FF Plus, I will personally take up this matter with the relevant ministers and the police. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_2',115,'0','0']));The charges are creating a dangerous situation – we cannot allow a certain group of people in South Africa to blatantly and unfairly apply double standards, particularly not towards the agricultural community and farmers. It creates the impression that racism is the underlying reason for the seriousness of the charges. The FF Plus will demand explanations and answers so as to get clarity on the matter.
