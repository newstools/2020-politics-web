NC Leadership: A time to come and a time to go  2 October 2020 I am looking forward to the DA Northern Cape Provincial Congress on 5 December where I will be handing over the baton to a newly elected DA leader of our fine province. While I will remain active within the DA, I will not avail myself for re-election as leader. I strongly believe that new leadership encourages fresh ideas and that it is a cornerstone of democracy. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0']));I am sincerely looking forward to working with the newly-elected leadership to take the DA to new heights. Our country will be facing daunting challenges, especially in the aftermath of Covid-19. But I firmly believe that the DA is the only party that can provide real solutions and a capable state. I want to thank my family, my colleagues and the people of the Northern Cape for their unwavering support over the past ten years that I served as leader.
