DA calls on President Ramaphosa to make a decision on the future of e-tolls 14 October 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng is calling on President Cyril Ramaphosa to decide on the future of e-tolls as a matter of urgency, before the Administrative Adjudication of Road Traffic Offences (Aarto) takes effect in July 2021 Last year, the DA raised concerns that operator class motor vehicles which do not pay e-tolls will be fined R500 and stand to lose one demerit point for every fine that is not paid. This has now subsequently been changed and while the motorist will not receive demerit points, a fine will still be incurred, which is now double for failing to pay e-tolls. The Act is just another way to force motorists to pay for e-tolls. The DA has always been against the implementation of e-tolls as this is an unfair burden on the residents of Gauteng who are already struggling to make ends meet. What is clear is that residents are not prepared to pay for e-tolls. We cannot have a situation where motorists are fined for something which they were not consulted on in the first place. For a long time now, the residents of Gauteng have been told that a decision about the future of e-tolls will be made soon and a year later, still no decision has been made. The e-toll system must be scrapped before it turns motorists into criminals. Issued by Fred Nel, DA Shadow MEC for Roads and Transport, 14 October 2020
