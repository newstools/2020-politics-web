EFF EXTENDS GRATITUDE TO MEMBERS AND GROUND FORCES Thursday, 29 October 2020 The Economic Freedom Fighters extends its gratitude to all members and ground forces for their support of the Commander in Chief Julius Malema and Commissar Mbuyiseni Ndlozi, in their trial against the racist Afriforum and racist Apartheid-cop Johannes Venter. The persecution of the CIC and Commissar Ndlozi is not based on reality, and the racist Johannes Venter has been exposed through the two-day proceedings as a liar who constantly contradicts himself. It was revealed clearly that he is acting on the instruction of racist lobby group Afriforum to waste the time of the judiciary and the leaders of the EFF. Johannes Venter is continuing his long legacy of tormenting black people. He is a man who has been in the police force for 36-years, serving murderers such as Pik Botha and F.W De Klerk directly. He was a member of the police force that terrorized our people in the 1980s during the state of emergency. We commend fighters for exhibiting discipline and commitment, by understanding that an attack on their leaders, who were restricted by a racist from burying their mother, is an attack on the revolution on themselves. The case has been postponed to the 9th of March 2021. There is absolutely no case to be heard, and this frivolous charge of assault is nothing but an attempt to distract the EFF by racists, who know they will never receive a decisive mandate to lead this country from our people. All that is left is for then to waste the time of black people because their desire to govern through oppression will never become a reality again. We encourage fighters to go to the ground and focus on building branches of the organization towards total victory in the 2021 Local Government Elections. Victory is certain!
