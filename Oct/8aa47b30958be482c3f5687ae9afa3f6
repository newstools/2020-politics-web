DA calls on MEC Mazibuko to investigate allegations that EMPD K-9 Unit dogs have reached retirement age 21 October 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng is calling on the Gauteng MEC for Community Safety, Faith Mazibuko to investigate the allegations that the Ekurhuleni Metro Police Department (EMPD) K-9 Unit dogs have reached retirement age but are still rendering services to the EMPD. We have also been reliably informed that one dog died last week and that the EMPD is only left with nine K-9 Unit dogs. The DA is worried that nine K-9 Unit dogs are insufficient to provide much needed services to the EMPD considering the fact that they all have reached their retirement age. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));According to the Ekurhuleni MMC for Community Safety, Cllr Frans Mmoko, the periods for replacement cannot be pre-determined, as prognosis can only be determined after the dog has been in service, assessing their in-service skills, health, and well-being. MMC Mmoko was responding to the DA’s written questions tabled in the Ekurhuleni Council. This clearly indicates that there is no plan and no timeframe with regards to the replacement of the EMPD K-9 Unit dogs. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2',114,'0','0']));MMC Mmoko further stated that a budget of R2 158 836,00 has been allocated in the 2020/2021 financial year for Animal Services, which means canine and equestrian services combined. This also includes medical costs, feed, and veterinary services. Worryingly, there is no allocated budget for the replacement of the EMPD K-9 Unit dogs. The K-9 Unit dogs are used for perimeter patrols, crowd control, building searches and the tracking of perpetrators from a crime scene and play a significant role in crime prevention. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','0']));The DA calls on MEC Mazibuko to initiate an urgent investigation into these allegations. Should these allegations prove to be true, the MEC should ensure that the EMPD K-9 Unit dogs are replaced as a matter of urgency.
