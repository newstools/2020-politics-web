DA welcomes suspension of Bheki Mlangeni Hospital CEO  23 October 2020eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0'])); The Democratic Alliance welcomes the precautionary suspension of Ruth Mabyana, the CEO of the Bheki Mlangeni Hospital in Soweto. According to the Gauteng Health Department, she faces a charge of misconduct. I have long campaigned for her removal as she has been a total failure ever since she was appointed as the first CEO of this hospital when it opened 6 years ago. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));She has proved incapable of securing the safety of patients and staff, with at least 12 violent attacks this year, including the murder of one patient and the alleged rape of another. Other scandals during her term include jobs-for-pay and poor quality services that have given the hospital a bad name amongst Soweto residents. We have seen before how she has bounced back from previous suspensions, so I hope that she is finally held to account for years of mismanagement and is removed permanently. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));Soweto residents deserve a capable management for this hospital which serves a large number of patients and is meant to take the strain off the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital.
