DA welcomes Zondo Commission decisions to summons Zuma 9 October 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomes the decision by the Zondo Commission of Inquiry to issue a summons for former President Jacob Zuma to testify in order for him to account for his role in State Capture allegations. Zuma has often spoken of how he wants to have his day in court, however, he has sought to delay and frustrate almost every opportunity for him to answer to allegations which implicate him before the Zondo Commission. South Africa has, quite frankly, become tired of Zuma and his Stalingrad tactics. The DA supports the Commission’s decision to summons the former President as we believe that it is in the interest of justice and accountability for him to submit himself to the processes of this Commission which was established in order to provide South Africans with the truth about the years of looting and corruption under the Zuma-administration. Zuma has over the past number of months sought to delegitimize the work of the Commission and the character of Judge Raymond Zondo. These unmerited attacks on the Commission are merely smokescreens to distract from revelations of one of the biggest acts of thievery our country has every seen. The DA commends the Commission for using its powers to force Zuma to appear before it, so that accountability and justice will not be delayed.
