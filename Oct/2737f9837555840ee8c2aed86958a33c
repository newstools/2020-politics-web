MEC Maile response to DA 6 October 2020 MEC for Human Settlements, Urban Planning and CoGTA Lebogang Maile notes the misleading and unfortunate statement issued by DA’s Member of the Provincial Legislature (MPL), Kingsol Chabalala, regarding the alleged suspension and lifting of suspension of Emfuleni Municipal Manager, Lucky Leseane. Chabalala has publicly made a false insinuation that “MEC Maile advised the Emfuleni Mayor to lift the suspension of the Municipal Manager because the Council did not follow proper procedures in suspending him and that the process was unlawful”. MEC Maile wants to state on record that he never advised the Mayor pertaining to this matter as alleged by Chabalala. Matters related to disciplinary measures against senior managers or labour dispute, squarely falls within the purview of the Municipal Council, and the MEC for Cooperative Governance has no statutory authority to intervene. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));MEC Maile view the allegations around the suspension of the Municipal Manager in a very serious light and has since sought a full report from the Executive Mayor. Once the MEC has been furnished with a full report, he will apply his mind accordingly. In the meantime, MEC Maile has demanded a retraction from DA’s Chabalala.
