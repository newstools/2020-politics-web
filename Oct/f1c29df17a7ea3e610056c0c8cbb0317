AfriForum Youth demands suspension of SAIPA’s racial policy 29 October 2020 AfriForum Youth today directed a letter to the South African Institute of Professional Accountants (SAIPA) in which the youth organisation demands that the institute suspends its racial policy. In a year in which COVID-19 caused so much economic damage, institutions such as the SAIPA now also wants to exclude people from its Project Achiever programme based on race. The objective of this programme is to prepare young accountants for the SAIPA’s professional evaluation exam so as to enable them to register as professional accountants afterwards. White, brown, Indian and Asian groups are excluded financially and treated as second-class citizens. Minority groups are given the option to buy access to the programme with payment, while it is free for black people. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));“It is indicative of the blatant racism and disconnection between the SAIPA and the South Africa society. There must be equal opportunities for all South African citizens, notwithstanding their race,” says Bernard Pieters, Manager of AfriForum Youth. AfriForum Youth thus demands that the SAIPA suspends its racial policy and treat all South African citizens equally, especially in a time of economic distress.
