Are 139 SAPS members accused of Gender Based Violence still in active duty? 20 October 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));In a reply to a Democratic Alliance (DA) parliamentary question, the Minister of Police, Bheki Cele, revealed that 139 SAPS members from 113 police stations across the country have had cases relating to Gender Based Violence (GBV) opened against them. Some of the reported cases against the perpetrators range from assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, statutory rape, rape, murder, domestic violence, attempted murder and pointing a firearm. The DA will be submitting supplementary questions to the Minister asking him to clarify whether the perpetrators have been charged for their offences, are in active duty or have been dismissed. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));Of major concern is that, of the 113 police stations in which the perpetrators work from, 5 of them are already in the top 30 list of GBV hotspots that was released by Minister Cele in September. These include: Umlazi in KZN Ntuzuma in KZN eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2',114,'0','0']));Bloemspruit in the Free State Mitchells Plain in the Western Cape Gugulethu in the Western Cape eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','0']));In a week in which Parliament is due to host public hearings on three bills relating to gender-based violence, it is important that Minister Cele takes a public stand against GBV by drawing the line against harboring of perpetrators within SAPS ranks. Violence against women is a national crisis and we cannot allow their re-victimisation at police stations manned by perpetrators of GBV. The fight against GBV requires a police service that women can trust and rely on during their time of need. The DA will continue to hold the Minister accountable to his avowed commitment to address the GBV crisis and ensure that SAPS meets the objectives set out in its GBV action plan.
