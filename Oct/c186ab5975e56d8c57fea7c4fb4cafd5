Fire at Bheki Mlangeni Hospital cost R5 million 12 October 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));The fire at the administration block of the Bheki Mlangeni Hospital on 20 May last year caused damage of R5 018 308, but investigations have not identified any employee at fault. This is revealed by Acting Health MEC Jacob Mamabolo in a written reply to my questions in the Gauteng Legislature. According to Mamabolo an electrical fault was suspected as the cause of the fire and he is satisfied with the reports into this matter which were done by the City of Johannesburg Fire Safety Department, the Department of Infrastructure, and Occupational Hygiene & Environmental Services: Gijima Technology People. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));But reports are still outstanding from SAPS and the Department of Labour, and some at the hospital blame the fire on an employee who allegedly left a heater on. This allegation does not appear to have been investigated properly. It is disappointing that this hospital has been dogged by building faults despite being opened only six years ago at a cost of R730 million. The hospital has also suffered from poor management, including a jobs-for-pay scandal, and has a poor reputation in the community. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));I support the call for by the Independent Liberation and Allied Workers Union (ILAWU), which is demonstrating today at the hospital, for the removal of the CEO Ruth Mabyana and other top officials.
