Malema, Ndlozi hearing to commence end of October 13 October 2020 The trial of Julius Malema, leader of the EFF, and Mbuyiseni Ndlozi, its spokesperson – each on a charge of assault – would have commenced in the Randburg Magistrate’s Court today. However, the Court ruled that the media may not broadcast today’s proceedings live and should first bring applications to this effect. The case was therefore postponed again to 28 and 29 October 2020. AfriForum and 16 other applicants applied today to report on the court proceedings on these days. After continued pressure from AfriForum, Malema and Ndlozi are being prosecuted by the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) for the alleged assault of a SAPS colonel. The incident was caught on closed-circuit TV cameras. This follows AfriForum’s announcement in July 2019 that it would bring a mandamus application to compel the NPA to decide whether or not to prosecute Malema and Ndlozi. AfriForum’s private prosecution unit also have a vigilance order in the case and supports the complainant and witnesses to prepare for the trial. Malema addressed the media today, saying among other things that the “white man” had to also provide evidence on camera if he (Malema) had to do so; also “black people who pretend to be black, where they are white inside”. There were numerous EFF supporters who protested outside the court. “AfriForum wants to ensure that justice prevails, and we are of the opinion that the case could have proceeded today. However, transparency is important to us and we therefore support the fact that the media was here today and applied for approval to report on future proceedings. AfriForum and its private prosecution unit will continue to monitor the case in the interest of justice,” says Ernst Roets, Head of Policy and Action at AfriForum.
