CSA agrees to release long-overdue forensic report following DA pressure 6 October 2020 The Cricket South Africa (CSA) board today committed to releasing its long-overdue forensic report into the organization’s administration by Friday. The board made this commitment today during a meeting of Parliament’s Portfolio Committee of Sports, Arts and Culture, where they were expected to share the contents of the forensic report. Following months of dithering the CSA board has finally succumbed to pressure from the Democratic Alliance (DA) and the Committee to make the report available by Friday. Questions have been raised on numerous occasions about the initial refusal to keep the contents of the forensic report from the public and Parliament.  The DA has consistently held the view that if CSA had nothing to hide, this report would have been published a long time ago. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));The reality is that cricket administration in South Africa is in shambles and is facing a financial crisis, administrative challenges and poor leadership. CSA cannot then expect Parliament to simply turn a blind eye to these problems. It is only sensible that the contents of the forensic report be in public domain. The DA is deeply disappointed by CSA’s delaying tactics and the disregard it has demonstrated towards Parliament as an oversight authority. We will continue to hold CSA to its word and will await the long-overdue release of this report by Friday.
