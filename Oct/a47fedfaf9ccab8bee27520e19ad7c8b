Alleged Tara rape should also be investigated 5 October 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));The Gauteng Health Department has indicated that it is probing two alleged rapes at public health facilities - one at Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Hospital that involves two male mental health patients, and another incident at Stanza Bopape clinic in Tshwane where a male staff nurse allegedly raped a male patient. I am concerned that there may be a cover-up of another alleged rape which I am informed took place at the Tara Mental Hospital on 16 September. This involved a 15-year-old female outpatient who came with her parents for therapy and was allegedly raped by another patient when she went out for fresh air. These incidents raise questions yet again about the adequacy of security at Gauteng public health facilities, especially for mental health patients. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_3',113,'0','0']));It is inexcusable that hospital security contracts that were irregularly awarded in 2014 for a two-year period have been extended month-by-month for four years at a cost of more than R2.5 billion. New security contracts need to be awarded as soon as possible to competent security companies that better protect patients and staff from all forms of violence at our public hospitals.
