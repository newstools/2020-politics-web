FF Plus lodges complaint with HRC against Malema and EFF supporters for singing “Kill the Boer” in Senekal 17 October 2020 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));The FF Plus strongly condemns EFF supporters singing the “Kill the Boer” song today in Senekal and lodged a complaint against the relevant supporters and Julius Malema, leader of the EFF, with the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC). This kind of behaviour is unacceptable. Farm murders are a reality and it is this kind of incitement and irresponsible statements that are without a doubt playing a significant role in farm attacks and murders. In 2003, the FF Plus was successful in its effort as the HRC declared that singing the song amounts to hate speech. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));Julius Malema must be held personally liable because he is openly advocating hate and violence. Before today's court case in Senekal, he even condoned the notion of a civil war. This incitement stirs up supporters and makes them behave recklessly, as was the case with the countrywide Clicks protests. Julius Malema is not above the law and it is time for action to be taken against him in the interest of all the people in the country.
