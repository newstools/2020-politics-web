DA reports EFF’s Malema and Paulsen to Ethics Committee over tweets inciting violence 8 October 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) will refer the EFF leader, Julius Malema, and EFF Member of Parliament, Nazier Paulsen, to Parliament’s Ethics Committee over recent social media posts which appear to incite violence. On Wednesday, Malema tweeted “Magwala a chechele morago! (Cowards move to the back) Fighters attack!”, in response to the incident of violence at the Senekal Magistrate's Court where the two accused in the murder of Brendin Horner appeared. Paulsen later posted a picture with a machine gun and a caption which read “Get ready!". The DA condemns these tweets for what they are – a blatant attempt by the EFF leadership to recklessly incite even further violence at this time. This type of behaviour is deplorable, especially coming from Members of Parliament who have a responsibility to uphold the rule of law and the principles which underpin our Constitution. We call on peace-loving South Africans not take cues from people who thrive on hate and division. South Africa finds itself in an increasingly fragile and volatile state and to overcome this we need strong and united leaders. Any person who incites violence and encourages the destruction of property should be apprehended and condemned. We cannot allow anyone who stirs up violence among our people to go unchallenged. The DA urges the Ethics Committee to investigate both Malema and Paulsen’s tweets and conduct. For a party that has thousands of followers on social media, such conduct is highly irresponsible.
