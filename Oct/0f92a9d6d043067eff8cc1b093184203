This means that in some instances, cases could be allocated to the wrong sub-districts. We are working with the sub-districts to clean and verify the data and where errors are picked up locally, cases will be re-allocated to the correct areas. The Western Cape has recorded an additional 11 deaths, bringing the total number of COVID-19 related deaths in the province to 4219. We send our condolences to their families and friends at this time. Medium term budget policy process: Today was the final day of the Western Cape Government budget bosberaad, which met to discuss the provincial funding priorities for the medium-term budget policy statement.  These discussions are part of the process to evaluate how the province will deliver over the next three years. Our provincial Covid-19 response has had a significant impact on budgets, but it has also unlocked new and innovative ways of working in this government. The discussions over the past two days have focused on how to use these innovations and lessons to deliver on our three post-Covid recovery fpcus areas of jobs, dignity and wellbeing and safety. Cabinet, leadership from our district municipalities and senior government officials have all deliberated on key interventions and budget requirements for each of these focus areas, over the next 100 days and over the medium term. Over the coming weeks, these discussions will be evaluated and packaged into the medium-term budget policy speech which will be delivered by Finance Minister David Maynier in November. Supporting agriculture and tourism to save jobs: Agriculture and tourism are two key drivers of job creation in the province- especially in our rural areas. Support by the Western Cape Government in these two sectors can help to save jobs and to develop new ones. One example of this is the installation and repair of agricultural fencing in the Rietpoort community. This project by the Department of Agriculture in the province, has erected 5.2km of new stock proof fencing, and replaced 15.6km of rundown fencing in the area. The project has created 100 jobs and more than 300 person working days, and at the same time, has helped farmers by protecting their livestock from predators, which in turn has seen their lambing percentages increase. eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-banner-1','ezslot_5',116,'0','0']));A project like this therefore doesn't only create new jobs, but by supporting farmers against losses, can also help to protect agricultural jobs on those farms. As part of our support for the tourism sector, Minister Maynier today launched the first phase of our international tourism campaign, which will be rolled out in Germany. Germany is one of our key international source markets, and one of the only ones that is currently cleared for leisure and business travel to South Africa. The campaign will also be rolled out in other markets in later phases. This campaign also runs in conjunction with our domestic campaign aimed at enticing South Africans to travel to the Western Cape and Western Cape residents to explore their own back yard. The Western Cape tourism sector has been significantly impacted by worldwide travel restrictions, as well as by the hard lockdown and restrictions on local travel, resulting in thousands of lost jobs. With some international travel now open, this campaign will help to remind international visitors of the best that the province has to offer and highlight our outdoor attractions which range from pristine beaches to breathtaking hiking trails. It is important that as we move forward, we do so safely so as to protect residents and visitors alike, and ensure that we are able to save jobs and help our economy recover further.
