DA welcomes High Court dismissal of Public Protector application to interdict Parliamentary inquiry 9 October 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomes the decision by the Western Cape Division of the High Court dismissing the Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s frivolous application to interdict Parliament’s inquiry into her fitness to hold office. Now there should be no delays for the Speaker of the National Assembly, Thandi Modise, to appoint an independent panel – which will determine whether there is a prima facie case for Parliament to proceed with the removal proceedings. Mkhwebane’s tenure as Public Protector dirties the once proud reputation of this vital Chapter 9 institution of holding the Executive to account without fear or favour. Under her guidance, the institution has suffered blow after blow in South African courts and leaves a clear impression of toothlessness and ineptitude. This interdict was clearly just an attempt by the Mkhwebane to delay and frustrate this inquiry and to invalidate a legitimate parliamentary process to remove her. She’s done immeasurable damage to the Office of the Public Protector. South Africa needs someone who is independent and above reproach to head up this institution. South Africans need to know that the Public’s Protector is above reproach and is fully vested in their interests above those of the rich and powerful who seek to capture the country for their own nefarious purposes.
