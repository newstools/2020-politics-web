DA notes alleged sexual harassment complaint against DA Gauteng Interim Leader Solly Msimanga 11 October 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng notes that a claim of alleged sexual harassment has been laid with the party leadership against DA Gauteng Interim Leader Solly Msimanga by DA Gauteng Member of the Legislature, Nkele Molapo. This complaint has been lodged with the party and is being dealt with through our party’s internal processes. It is alleged that the sexual harassment occurred seven years ago. The timing of reporting this incident raises questions about the veracity of the complaint. Furthermore, it should be noted that the complainant Ms Molapo is undergoing a serious disciplinary hearing. We have trust in our internal processes that they will be able to ascertain what happened and whether the allegations are true or false. We also welcome the fact that our interim Provincial Leader has agreed to subject himself to a full investigation by any relevant body. He has also agreed to do a lie detector test on this matter and will make the results available to the public. We also note that our interim Provincial Leader has laid charges of crimen injuria against the complainant. We call on the public to wait for the final findings of the internal process and not to make any judgements and conclusions on the matter.
