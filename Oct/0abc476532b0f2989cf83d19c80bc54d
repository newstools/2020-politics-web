Minister of Sport, Arts and Culture (DSAC) gives Cricket South Africa (CSA) notice of Government Intervention 14 October 2020 Following a series of meetings with CSA and most recently a meeting on 12 October, Minister Nathi Mthethwa has sent a letter to its Acting President, Mr Beresford Williams. Efforts have been made over several months to try and assist CSA to stabilise its governance matters. This, after a huge outcry regarding the failure of its Leadership to effectively manage its affairs. Minister Mthethwa said “Having evaluated the discussions as well as the subsequent reporting on this matter, I have now reached a point where I see no value in any further engagement with CSA”. When the SASCOC initiative yielded no positive results, the Minister personally held several meetings with the CSA Board and also met with the Members Council. Similarly, further engagements have been held between SASCOC and the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee, also with negative outcomes. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));Minister Mthethwa strongly believes that there is great merit in creating an environment where sports problems are handled within the sports movement and accordingly wishes to offer them every possible opportunity to demonstrate their stated commitment to cooperate on a way forward for cricket. Furthermore, the Minister has given a notice of Government intervention to the International Cricket Council (ICC) in the affairs of CSA. In the interest of fairness, Minister Mthethwa has given CSA until 17:00 on 27 October 2020 to make written representations, should they wish to, on why he should not exercise his decision to intervene as enjoined by the laws of the country. The ball is now firmly in the court of CSA.
