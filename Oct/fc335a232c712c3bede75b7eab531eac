DA calls on MEC Lesufi to ensure that the admission process for Grades 1 and 8 is finalised before the end of November 8 October 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng is calling on the Gauteng MEC for Education, Panyaza Lesufi to ensure that the online admission placement process for Grades 1 and 8 for the 2021 academic year is finalised by the end of November 2020. The Gauteng Admission Online Applications period for Grades 1 and 8 learners for the 2021 academic year was closed on 25 July 2020. This follows last year’s disastrous experience where many parents applied online for their children for Grades 1 and 8 and had not secured school placement timeously. It is important that the online admission placement process is finalised by the end of November 2020 to give both parents and schools enough time to prepare for the 2021 academic year. The DA believes that the department should use the current applications as an indicator for the need for additional resources for schools such as recruiting more teachers, providing additional classrooms, building new schools and delivery of LTSM. The department should avoid last minute interventions which results in the disruption of learning and teaching in January and February each academic year. The DA supports the online admission process and, if it is properly managed, will help to save time for both parents and schools and prevent unnecessary long queues and also increase transparency. The department must fix all the glitches and communicate with all parents who applied on time. The DA will table further questions to MEC Lesufi at the next Gauteng Provincial Legislature’s Education Portfolio Committee meeting to ascertain the progress made to date with regards to the online admission placement process.
