The fires have destroyed livestock, game, grazing, vehicles and infrastructure. A local farmer Mr Tewie Nel has also been seriously injured. The agricultural community in these areas are in dire need of urgent assistance from government and the Democratic Alliance (DA) has therefore requested that the necessary processes are put in place to declare the area a disaster area in a letter to the Premier of the Free State. This will facilitate the allocation of the necessary resources to assist the affected communities. The resources required are, however, urgent and any support to the local agricultural sector cannot be subjected to bureaucratic delays. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));The DA in the Free State welcomes the request by the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development to Minister, Ms Thoko Didiza, to similarly declare these areas disaster areas. The DA further welcomes the arrest of the individuals who are allegedly responsible for this devastation by the SAPS. Veld fires have a devastating socials and economic impact of the agricultural sector. The DA has previously requested the provincial government to budget for these annual eventualities across the province which could avert cumbersome bureaucratic delays in rendering assistance to the farming communities in the fire season.
