SAPS members lying about k-word will be sentenced in court tomorrow 20 October 2020 Solidarity will appear with Lieutenant Colonel Annemarie Oosthuizen in the Klerksdorp Regional Court in Stilfontein on 21 October to give aggravating evidence against the two SAPS members who were convicted of various criminal charges including crimen injuria, defeating the ends of justice, perjury and assault. The appearance follows after sentencing was postponed on July 19. Oosthuizen was accused by two warrant officers of the SAPS, SedisaTikoe and Chris Mphana, of using the k-word. The two SAPS members threatened her and made false accusations of racism against her. This was after Oosthuizen started a disciplinary process against the two culprits because they did not show up for work and did not have the necessary permission. "The conviction of the two SAPS members was already a great victory, not only for Lieutenant Colonel Oosthuizen and Solidarity but for every other SAPS member against whom false accusations of racism are made. Sentencing makes it clear that random use of the ‘race card’ where it is not justified will no longer be tolerated by our courts,” says Renata Barnard, sector coordinator of the public sector at Solidarity.
