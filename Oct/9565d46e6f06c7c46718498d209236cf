DA ready and excited for Voter Registration Weekend, ahead of 11 November by-elections  3 October 2020 The DA is ready and excited for voter registration activities across South Africa this weekend, ahead of a massive number of by-elections to be held on 11 November this year. This first voter registration event, since the Covid lockdown, sees the wheels of participatory democracy begin to turn again across South Africa after a long pause in electoral events. On 11 November by-elections will be held in 96 wards, in 56 municipalities countrywide. Voter registration for these elections will take place this weekend, on Saturday 3 and Sunday 4 October, and the DA encourages voters to make use of this opportunity to ensure that they are registered. The DA reminds voters in these Wards: “If you are not registered, you cannot vote. So, all DA voters are encouraged to register to vote in these by-elections, this weekend.” Voters can check their details on the roll by sending their ID number via sms to 32810. Registration details can also be verified at local voting stations which are open this weekend at the following times: eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2',114,'0','0']));Saturday, 08:00 to 17:00 Sunday, 08:00 to 17:00 Eligible first-time voters can also register at these stations, to become active participants in our democracy. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_3',115,'0','0']));We are pleased that the independent electoral commission is ensuring that all necessary health protocols are observed, as the Covid virus remains a threat.
