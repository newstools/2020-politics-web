We wish to correct this. This was a typographical error which occurred when the total number was recorded, following verification. We therefore confirm that yesterdayâ€™s total number of deaths for KwaZulu Natal was 3 136. This means the total number of deaths nationally for 18 October 2020 was 18 431. We apologise for this error. Regrettably, we report 61 COVID-19 related deaths today: 21 from Eastern Cape, 19 from the Free State, 3 from Gauteng, 1 from Mpumalanga 6 from Northern Cape, 8 from Western Cape and 3 from KwaZulu Natal. This brings the total number of COVID-19 related deaths to 18 492. Of the 61 deaths reported today, 11 were re- ported to have occurred in the past 24-48 hours: 3 in Gauteng, 1 in Mpumalanga and 7 in the Western Cape. We extend our condolences to the loved ones of the departed and thank the health- care workers that treated the deceased patients. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2',114,'0','0']));Our recoveries now stand at 635 257 which translates to a recovery rate of 90% Province Total Deaths Total Recoveries Active Cases Eastern Cape 3451 86927 1744 Free State 1320 36702 15657 Gauteng 4621 204424 16514 KwaZulu-Natal 3139 112205 6092 Limpopo 435 15759 655 Mpumalanga 591 27534 705 North West 393 28589 2882 Northern Cape 254 16933 3194 Western Cape 4288 106184 4062 National 18492 635257 51505 Issued by Department of Health, 19 October 2020
