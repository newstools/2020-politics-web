DA calls for independent investigation into CSA, as board tables whitewashed forensic report  13 October 2020 The Democratic Alliance (DA) calls for the establishment of an independent committee to investigate the ongoing challenges within Cricket South Africa (CSA). This comes as the CSA board finally released its long-overdue forensic report into the organization’s administration following sustained pressure from the DA and Parliament’s Portfolio Committee of Sports, Arts and Culture. Following our initial reading of the report, the DA is of the view that the allegations in the report was not compiled or investigated independently. The report’s findings focus almost solely on the alleged misconduct of Thabang Moroe, but fail to finger those who may have been in cahoots with the former CSA CEO. The report also does not contain any recommendations on turning around the mismanagement and malfeasance within the cricket association. The report effectively attempts to scapegoat one person for the crisis within CSA. The financial crisis, administrative challenges and poor leadership at CSA cannot be laid solely at the feet of one man. All board members and executives, past and present, who were involved in CSA’s maladministration should be investigated. It is for this reason that the DA calls for an independent investigation into the administration of CSA dating from 2016 to present. We will not accept this whitewashed report which essentially absolves the CSA board and other senior executives from any wrongdoing related to the past six years of decline in CSA’s administration.
